    Ok gang, this baby took me a heck of a long time to get all
of the atmosphere right, it seems that the linedef tags 999 and 99
aren't only used for stairs after all, check the maze to see what
I mean. I think Id alternated 99 and 999 simply so the could have
both rising stairs and smooth pulsing sectors, the only reason for
two different oddball #'s.

    Secrets, yes there are alot of them ;) Don't expect to find them
all the first few times through (unless you're one of those cheating
types, then hey more power to ya), but none conceal "must have" items,
just boons. I manage to come off the level with max health and armor
on Ultra-Violence, but then I know where the secrets are. One hint:

    Take a few seconds to look around, I'm sure something will pop
up, especially early on.

    Another hint, well nah, you'll see the first time you play ;)

    Also, No Cyber/Spider demons here, I save them for when it's
important (aka my level 8).

    Well I could babble on forever, but I know you're dying to play
this wad, so ENJOY!
