Description             : D9 is the utimate in Deathmatch level
                          design! Made especialy for the hard core
                          player. Consider it your owne personal
                          dungeon of death! There are two weapons of 
                          each type in all levels, no slime pits for
                          those pussy suicide attempts and no monsters.
                          All exits are co-op, so no scaredy cat
                          escapes! This 3 level mini episode is the 
                          start of an entire 9 level DM episode! I am
                          curently working on these 6 other levels and
                          will release them upon compleation so enjoy
                          these for now! Also D9 has its reject data
                          rebuilt at a setting of 32 witch should vastly 
                          improve the performance on lower end computers.
