Misc. Author Info       : Most of the work was done by Daugman.
                          I did the redesign of the Nuclear Plant,
                          the new title, and the "distributing".
Description             : "Bloodbath" - the title says it all.
                          New, meaner Knee Deep levels and this
                          time, the buildings make more sense
                          (ie. the Hangar is a real hangar, the
                          Nuclear Plant is a real Nuclear Plant
                          equipped with a core and everything).
                          Six tough levels for you to wade through.
Notes                   : Beware of the Command Center (E1M4).  This
                          one is extremely tough if you warp into it.
                          The levels get progressively tougher and were
                          designed to be played in sequence - although
                          each level has been tested by warping in to
                          make sure it IS possible to complete each one
                          starting with just a pistol.  However, it is
                          extremely difficult and probably requires many
                          tries to do so.  Don't say I didn't warn you! :)

Known Bugs              : A few of the levels have HOM effect when viewing

                          find what's causing them.  Some may be due to too
                          many 2S linedefs in a line of sight.
