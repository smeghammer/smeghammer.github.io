Description:    A great DeathMatch level.

		This level is specifically designed for DEATHMATCH play.
		If you want to experience the ultimate DeathMatch level
		try MEGADETH by this author. It's the best available!

		DETHSTAR incorporates the use of enhanced weapons.

		Laser sights and MegaViolence mode are independently
		switchable.
		



Story:          You decide you've had enough of this fighting lark and
		accept the demons' invitation to tea and cream cakes aboard
		the Dethstar. Unfortunately, there's no Earl Grey left so
		you get a bit annoyed... 

		This will be your toughest mission yet and you will have
		Earth's most advanced weaponry available to you: guns with
		laser sights, silencers and enhanced firepower!



Gameplay:       DETHSTAR is designed solely for deathmatches although all
		other modes are supported.


Enhanced
Weapons:        DETHSTAR is an assassination mission and therefore gives
		you access to enhanced weapons. These incorporate laser
		sights for the pistol, shotgun and chaingun. (Laser
		sights are optional.)

		The laser sights are not used for the rocket launcher,
		plasma rifle and BFG9000 because these weapons have a blast
		radius and do not need precise aiming.

		The laser sights will auto-dim when you enter darkened areas
		to avoid giving your position away  :))

		Like with the real thing, if you keep the trigger down on
		the pistol, shots will tend to wander after the first one.
		It is best to release the trigger after each shot. This also
		applies to the chaingun. Short controlled bursts of fire are
		most effective.

		For super-enhanced weapons, try MegaViolence mode.




MegaViolence
Mode:           MegaViolence mode only operates with Doom V 1.2. You must also
		ensure you have at least 581 Kb free on your hard disc for the
		installation program to create a backup of DOOM.EXE. This mode 
		gives you access to enhanced super-weapons :))

		In this mode, you have enhanced hand to hand combat, a quick
		-fire auto-pistol, a rapid re-load shotgun, a 2200 rounds
		per minute chaingun, a rapid re-load rocket launcher firing
		super high explosive ammo, a fast-fire plasma gun and a
		rapid-fire BFG9000.

* Instructions *        To activate the LASER SIGHTS, type "LASERON" at
			the DOS prompt. This will work for all Doom levels.
			To switch the laser sights off, type "LASEROFF" at
			the DOS prompt.

			To activate MEGAVIOLENCE MODE, type "MEGAON" at
			the DOS prompt (Doom V1.2 only & 581 Kb free disc
			space). This will work for all Doom levels. To
			switch back to ordinary mode, type "MEGAOFF" at
			the DOS prompt.

* Compatibility *	This version 1.1 is compatible with the LASER and
			MEGAVIOLENCE files packed with MEGADETH V 2.4 and
			V 2.4a.



* Play Guide *
			This WAD should not be judged by playing it in
			single player or cooperative modes, but if you
			insist on playing it this way then try skill
			level 4.

			For an extremely violent game, use MegaViolence
			mode. However, this mode significantly reduces
			the strategy element of the game.
