This includes several changes since DISGRUN2:

                        New TITLEPIC graphic.
                        New textures: Comrade Bill pal-ing around
                                with Sarah Brady; "I'd join the ATF"
                                recruiting poster.
                        Fix bad texture in one room.
                        Fine-tune difficulty levels.
                        Fine-tune light intensity values.

The most frequent email is "[How] can I run this with DOOM II?"  You
can't, sorry.  Anyone want to port this to DOOM II?  Feel free.

FBI and BATF lovers, please educate yourselves before flaming me.  I'm
open to serious discussion but "F*** YOU, YOU COP KILLING COMMIE" from
someone who has no idea there is any controversy about Waco will only
get you added to my procmail reject file.  I am including Carol Moore's
excellent text file "The Massacre of the Branch Davidians: A Study of
Government Violations of Rights, Excessive Force and Cover Up" making
this a complete anti-Federal Law Enforcement multimedia event!  Please

Title                   : Disgruntled Former Employee
Date Finished           : 2/11/95

Email Address           : lmulcahy@nyx.cs.du.edu

Misc. Author Info       : Remember Waco.  20X the number of deaths at
                          Kent State, including women and children.
                          "We had to destroy the children in order
                          to save them."  The FBI and BATF should be
                          disbanded for these atrocities and Janet
                          Reno, Louis Freeh and Bill Clinton should
                          face criminal charges.

Description             : One awful day, the misguided management at
                          your high-paying UAC desk job decides it would
be a good idea to replace all the SGI Unix workstations with Apple Macs.
You refuse to cooperate and soon your manager informs you that your
services will no longer be required at UAC.

Like any red-blooded American, after weeks or months of brooding on this
indignity, you determine that your only recourse is to grab your gun and
as much ammo as you can carry, stroll into your former workplace and
TAKE OUT AS MANY OF THEM AS YOU CAN before they get you.

You phone your buddy up to warn him.  "Better take the day off Monday in
case something terrible happens."  "Huh, what do you mean?  What could
happen?" "Just take the day off, do it!"

The day arrives.  Getting an elevator to yourself, you pull out your
trusty Glock on the way up.  Funny, there didn't seem to be the usual
number of people coming and going in the lobby.  And what about all
those black vans parked outside and all the black helicopters buzzing
around. Could your buddy have squealed?  Nah...

The elevator door opens.  AGGHH!! The building is crawling with Federal
Law Enforcement agents, the same Gestapo-like goons responsible for the
death of Vicky Weaver and the Waco massacre!  The elevators are locked!
Barricades have fallen into place in the stairways!  The building is
surrounded by machine gun nests!  The heavily armed Feds have plastered
Clinton posters everywhere!  Can you show these guys that an armed and
desperate psycho is not so easy to kill as all those unarmed women and
children?  Can you blast a path to freedom?

Installing DISGRUNT:  Go to your doom directory and extract the files
using PKUNZIP:

    pkunzip disgrun3.zip

For maximum white-knuckle enjoyment, you will want to perform the
graphics sprite changes.  

After being duly chastised by Olivier Montanuy, I have decided to try
DEUSF technique of installing custom sprites instead of the PERL/DMGRAPH
approach used by a previous version.  Advantages: does not alter
DOOM.WAD; smaller .ZIP file.

The install batch file is still called DISGINST.BAT.  Run this, and it
will append the sprites from your DOOM.WAD file to the file DISGSPR.WAD
yielding a new DISGSPR.WAD containing all the sprites DOOM needs to run.
DISGINST.BAT creates two other batch files, DISGRUNT.BAT (to play) and
UNINSTAL.BAT (zaps the 2+ MB DISGSPR.WAD back to its original 250K size).
You now need to add both DISGSPR.WAD and DISGRUN3.WAD on the doom
command line; see DISGRUNT.BAT for an example.

The sprite changes are:

    barrel => Apple Macintosh 
    former human trooper => FBI Rifleman
    former human sergeant => Shotgun-Wielding BATF Agent
    imp => Special Elite Flamethrower-Wielding BATF Agent
        (Due to the heavy load of highly flammable napalm carried
        by this type of BATF agent, a mere bullet or shotgun round
        can cause the same grisly explosion with chunks of flesh 
        flying everywhere usually seen only with a rocket hit).
    demon => Law Enforcement-style German Shepherd

Comments: The level is modelled after a single floor of a former
employer's building.  

I'd be interested in hearing from anyone who can help me transform the
cyberdemon into a tank.  I would think there'd be a view of a tank from
all eight orthogonal and diagonal directions floating around
somewhere...  A similar 8-way view of Janet Reno's head would be way
cool, picture it pasted onto the torso of a cyberdemon... perhaps with
the FBI logo on its' chest...  Anyone know where I could get a floor
plan of the Branch Davidian complex?
