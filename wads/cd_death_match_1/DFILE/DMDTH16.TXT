Description             : This level was designed for the the DOOM 1.6 
                          Deathmatch 2.0 regeneration feature. There is 
                          only one place to get your weapons (but it cannot
                          be considered a campsite).  There are many places 
                          to find your heath, armor, and weapons. Most places
                          are difficult to find.  That adds to the excitement 
                          Deathmatch--Search for both the means and your prey.
                          There is one Invulnerabilty sphere.  While easy to 
                          get, it should be hard to find.  The level was 
                          designed to avoid any campsites--(Great resupply 
                          places, the other guy knows it and only one way is 
                          through him.)

Additional Credits       :I would like to acknowledge the assistance of David 
                          Bruni who wrote the DoomEd - Real Thing Tutorial.  
                          His writings finally helped me understand how to 
                          build stitched stairs and teleporters.
