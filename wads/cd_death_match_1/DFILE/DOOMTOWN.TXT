Story description   :After six hard years on the rim worlds, blowing away
parole violators. It's time for some well deserved R & R.  You're on leave and
you decide to return to Earth and visit some old friends still living where you
grew up, in Varsen, Texas. It's a small chunk of real estate, but it's your
home town, and you can't wait to see the old place.  
    You get in late and the environ shells have been raised to protect the
town from the violent dust-storms that ravage this corner of  the badlands. 
Not much different from PL-923, when you and your squad were caught out in
the open for two days.   You survived, but there's always a price to pay,
that's why the Med core "made" you go on leave.  They're worried about your
violent tendencies, and think you needed a "little rest".  Med-techs-- what do
they know anyway? 
    As you get to your apartment, and throw your plasma rifle into the closet,
and strip off your armor, then slump into bed.   The apartment is across from
the helo-jet pad. Landing lights, blink in a steady rhythm lulling you off to
sleep.  You find that you toss and turn all night. Noises in the street keep
pulling you awake, but you're home and safe, so you drop back off to a
restless slumber.   
    Early morning, you're JOLTED  awake. Suddenly the large window of your
apartment is smashed out.  Jumping from of bed you slide near the window,
something's wrong!  Pulling on your bdu's, you grab your standard issue E-1146
plasma rifle and  lick the front sight. You grab a spare energy cell, and strap
on your armor.  You SLAM the rifle against your chest and pump yourself up,
you're ready to move into the hallway to vaporize whatever the Hell's out
there! 
    Something IS terribly wrong!  Taking inventory you remember that your
long time friend the Mayor,  has an  access key for Uncle Otis' two stores.
(The General store and The Gun store) The Mayor's condo is on another
street. Bursting into the hall you scan left, then right. A pair of "Things" at
the end of the hall grunt and drool, and make sounds like a cow in heat.
"What the hell are you?" you scream, forgetting diplomacy as you level your
plasma rifle, and burn holes clean through the mutants. They disappear to the
end of the hall in a cloud of their own blood. "Damn right!" Making sure there
are no more, you move towards the door, it's locked. No key. Wait a second,
the janitor closet at the end of the hall. Yeah,  he's got to have a key. Going
to the door, you step through the freshly crisped remains of slightly familiar
left over scum. You open the Janitor's closet, there he is,  poor fellow's dead
on the floor. You take his key, reminding yourself to tell his family later...
much later. Running to the end of the hall, the door's sensor idents your pass
card. You exit onto the street only to come face to face with more of these
mutant scumbags! Doing your best ancient movie "Rambo" impersonation, you
begin to blindly blast away at the pseudo-humans, not caring if you catch any
civilians in the firefight. You turn the corner, more of them, but now they're
shooting back. You're really  pissed off now! After about an hour of killing
these vile creations of Satan, you make it to your Uncle Otis' Gun shop and
stock up. 
    You realize cousin Vinnie still lives on the other side of town, (his
favorite hangout of course: The Gentlemen's Club along the way.) Body count
by this time? You've lost count, but it's got to be around four hundred. Blood
is thick, and everywhere.  Traction gets slippery when you walk, you might as
well be ice-skating.  You notice some walls have been affected by all the
energy released from plasma guns. You can look clean through some of them, 
and you notice something else weird about the walls, but file it away for
future reference. 
    Strange, the town folk  are not around. I guess it's up to you to clear the
town of these creatures on your own! Tunnels connecting sections of  town
are closed.  You'd better take a short cut through the underground water
reclamation plant, and avoid the sewers... for now.  Near the Police station
and your favorite cafe, you jump through the door leading to the plant.
    A run down the steps inside the water reclamation plant where Cousin
Vinnie  works, you stumble upon a single mutant soldier, poking mindlessly at
a blank control panel, too bad you dropped your weapons (you managed to save
your pistol)  jumping through the plant door,  it almost closed on you. 
Leveling your pistol, you quickly open up two holes in his back. "Piece of
shit!" too bad he fell in the water, his ammo gone. Oh well, not a problem.
You remember  your cousin Vinnie keeps a spare shotgun in his change room.
You quickly grab the shotgun, loading solid copper shot into the gun's feed
tube. You rack the shotgun, and get excited at the feel of this superb weapon.
There is nothing better than a pump action 12 gauge, pointed, point-blank at
the chest of a scumbag, is there? You ride an access elevator to street level,
and open the door, you fire! Three pseudo-humans with one shot, "Damn your
good,"  killing three more, you charge into the street and see more mutants
running toward you. Only four choices, the Bar, the Dark Alley, or two
streets, good luck!
