Description        : What a tour of Duty!  After clearing out the moon base,
		     you've returned to earth for some long overdue relaxation.
		     After setting down on mother earth, you decide a week in the 
		     desert would do you some good.  You've heard about a 5 star
		     hotel in a small resort town that your hazard pay should just
		     about cover.  Some sun and fun is just what the doctor ordered.
			  
		     You arrive in the middle of the night hot and exhausted.  You
		     lumber up to the night clerk and ask for a room.  The clerk, a 
		     scrawny guy who runs of at the mouth, greets you with style.
			  
		     "Welcome!  we have your room already prepared.  We have many 
		     excellent activities for you while your here.  We have
		     an award winning restaurant with a view of the stars that is 
		     perfect for breakfast or dinner.  Although if you don't like
		     the food, don't tell the waiter.  The chef is kind of a hot head.
		     We also have an Olympic size swimming pool that makes for a first
		     rate workout and a cool soaking.  A word of warning though, watch 
		     out for the pool hogs.  We have a convention here and they seem to 
		     take over the conference room and the pool at certain periods of the
		     day and boy are they ugly.  Speaking of ugly, you should see the 
		     couple in the honeymoon suite.  I guess they will marry anybody now
		     a days.  For a good night of activities try the nightclub.  They have a 
		     disco floor, a wide screen T.V., and a mud wrestling pit.  I hope you
		     enjoy your stay, and if you have any problems, stop by the desk and 
		     let the clerks know.  We are here to serve.  Your room is up the 
		     elevator to the left and the second door on the left.  Have a good
		     nights rest."

		     You stagger to the elevator and down to your room.  Unpacking your 
		     gear you bed down for the night.  Tomorrow is another day....
