Description             : My first attempt at creating a WAD for Doom.
                          Actually, finished this about 2 months ago
                          and never got around to putting it on line.
                          You enter this mission to try to destroy a 
                          group of madmen who are breeding imps and other
                          "nasties".  This level is not difficult, but 
                          does have a few surprises.  A few secret rooms
                          are scattered about, with a few "goodies" in them.
                          I learned much while creating this level, and this 
                          will be seen when I finish my second level...
                          
                          Any comments are welcomed and appreciated.
