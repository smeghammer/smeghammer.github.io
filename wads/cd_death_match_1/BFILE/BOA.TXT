Email Address           : amurphy@hurri.kean.edu, murfs1@aol.com
Misc. Author Info       : First really cool wad, probably be level
                          seven in my "Barons Everywhere" episode
                          which is now just 2 levels from completion
                          It will be without an orginal secret level
                          because episode 2's secret level has four
                          barons in one room. This level contains the
                          secret ending to the secret level
                          
Description             : Dark and Stoney, lots of marble all around
                          Tons of enemies to kill, and you must
                          use strategy or you'll get your ass kicked
                          really bad. Running into rooms with a 
                          flaming gun will make you dead real fast.
                          Has some stairwells, and a spiral staircase
                          that I think is a first in wads (if not
                          tell me).
