Misc. Author Info       : Started creating patch files in July, 1994

Description             : My first set of four patch files (more levels in
                          the works). I really love the action packed levels
                          on Doom, so I have tried to really take my favorite
                          monster moods and put them into a full action series
                          of increasingly more complex levels.

Additional Credits to   : Eric Hunsader and Michael Phillips for their testing
                          and feedback on my levels.
