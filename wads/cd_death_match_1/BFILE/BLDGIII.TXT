Description             : Building III -- Southern Illinois
                          University at Edwardsville, three  
                          hundred years into the future.
                          Primarily a plasma rifle level.

                          Best if played using the cheat code "idclevXX"
                          to ward directly to level in single player
                          mode.  Cooperative and Deathmatch are also
                          pretty cool.
