Title                   : RRWARD01.WAD (all the cool names were taken)

Misc. Author Info       : You don't want to know...
Description             : This is a _very_ large file, owing to the 
                          detail given to the level (lots of linedefs)
                          and the shear size of the map.  This map is
                          designed primarily for single player games,
                          but has multi-player starts, and an interesting 
                          consession for DeathMatch, though the map was not
                          designed for DeathMatch.  This map took over
                          150 "man-hours" to create, and outgrew both
                          DEU 5.0 and DEU 5.1's memory allocation schemes.
                          There are no "step wrong and die" traps - If you can
                          get into an area (without cheating) you can get out.
                          There are secrets, hidden doors and switches galore
                          in this map.

                          This is a re-release with two minor fixes (linedef
                          changes and one texture change).  This file replaces
                          the older RRWARD01.WAD and RRWARD01.ZIP.
