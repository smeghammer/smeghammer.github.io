Description             : Three classic Doom levels complete with
                          all three keys, traps, secret doors,
                          and of course, lots of targets.  These
                          levels are an attempt to mirror the
                          mood and detailed maps that made the
                          original game so much fun.  Stress 
                          was placed on QUALITY.  

                          Attention veterans of MAKDOOM1 or 2;
                          I have attempted to create a slightly 
                          more difficult level with E2M3.  (It
                          only makes sense that things will
                          gradually get nastier.)  Also, there 
                          are some new "tricks" in MAK's bag.
                          Nothing you Doomaholics can't pummel 
                          with ease... almost.  8^o

                          For those experiencing multi-player
                          slow down...  E2M3 is slightly bigger 
                          than the previous two (sorry).  I'm 
                          using the best node builder for NET 
                          play, so look at a FAQ for suggestions 
                          on speeding things up.  BTW, me and the
                          Beta-test psychos have no problem with
                          MAKDOOM3 on a Novell 3.11 486 server 
                          (950 speed rating) with 10baseT lines
                          and 486 workstations. (no chop at all)

                          This should only be used with the 
                          registered version of Doom as it
                          replaces the second episode.
                          
                          Please E-mail me if you have the time
                          and let me know what you think....
                          If you like it, I'll make more.

                          The authors of the editors mentioned
                          below, they are all great programs...

                          The Beta testers who put up with MANY
                          stupid bugs, any that remain are my
                          oversight, not theirs...

                          Finally, thanks to all those who have
                          e-mailed or written me with comments
                          and suggestions, you have "kept the
                          barrel warm" and enabled the
                          completion of a THIRD twisted level...
