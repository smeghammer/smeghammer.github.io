Summary:

A fight between the Cyberdemon and the Spiderdemon has to be one of the 
most talked about battles in DOOM. Who wins? Well, it seems that the closer
they are together, the more of a chance the Spiderdemon will win. 

This .LMP consists of three battles altogether - two with Cyber vs. Spider,
and then the winners take each other ont. I won't give away who wins...

- Michael.
