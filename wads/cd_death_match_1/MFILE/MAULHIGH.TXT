Hi all, This is an entirely new pwad for doom. I did most of the 
work for this level last summer, but only recently put on the
finishing touches. I spent A LOT of time on this wad, working on the
textures and perfecting the lighting. I think you will also find
another surprise all over the level that took a long time to do. I
hope that all my work has produced a fine pwad that you will like.
Also, I must say, bitchin music!

Enjoy!

MAULHIGH.WAD is for registered DOOM.

I've also released MAULHI2.WAD for DOOM II.

Short Description       : In MAULHIGH, the creatures of the pit have
			  created their own version of a highschool.
			  This seems reasonable enough, I always
			  thought highschool was close to hell. But
			  there is the slight possibility they might
			  actually learn something and the idea of
			  barons of hell with mass produced plasma
			  rifles and combat armor is quite unsettling.
			  You must end this before it can get started.	
		
Description		: Take on hell spawn in a highschool setting
			  you could only find in DOOM. The level is
			  fully equiped with lockers (with strange
			  contents), teachers (Ha! take THIS Mrs.
			  Bolton! BOOM!), students (poor saps, put
			  them out of their misery), a floating
			  principal and a detention must worse than
			  any that's ever been seen before! Then, in
			  the final areas you must pass the tests to
			  get out alive. By the way, remember to
			  always flush!! and don't eat the food.
		
Additional Credits to   : Id, the authors of DEU, IDBSP, WAD_DWD,
