After too many hours I have finally completed my second complete external wad
file for use with the registered version of Doom.  As promised, the zip file
also contains a re-release of my first wad megawatt.wad.  This new version of
megawatt has the bugs fixed and now has difficulty levels implemented.  For
those easily offened by satanic overtones, neither level uses any satanic
textures.  Megawatt replaces level one of episode one and Megalab replaces
level two of episode one.  Both levels contain multi-player and deathmatch
starting points, and skill level options.

To load the levels enter:  Doom -file megawatt.wad megalab.wad
        (Make sure both wads are in the Doom directory)
                                                       
Megawatt was built with the Deu 4 beta editor, and Megalab was completed with
Deu 4 beta, then the new Deu 5, and nodes built with BSP v1.1 beta.  I can
almost garuntee there will be no clipping.  I must give credit to the new
Deu 5 for its auto texture align feature as Megalab would not have been
released this soon.

For those who enjoyed Megawatt, my new Megalab level should be equally
enjoyable if not more.  Neither level abuses the player by adding too many
monsters so you should find both reasonable to play.  I hope you enjoy and
would appreciate any feedback at the above internet e-mail address.  I will
graduate after the 6th so my e-mail address will no longer be valid, so don't
bother sending me mail after that date.  I will hopefully get a new account
in my home town within a few weeks afterwards.

                               Good luck on your kills,
