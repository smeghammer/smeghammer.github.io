Description             : The DEATH STAR!!!  Based on blueprints of a
                          set built for the movie and as well as 
                          information contained in the SW RPG. These
                          are the first of many Star Wars levels I
                          will do, and I will eventually replace 
                          these levels' textures with my own.  Doors
                          needing keys aren't marked by colors 
                          primarily because I wanted the levels to 
                          look as much like Death Star as possible.
                   -----> If the game runs to slowly, just run an 
         IMPORTANT!-----> easier setting to limit the number of 
                   -----> monsters (they slow down slower machines).
                          This isn't as bad as it used to be now that
                          I've used a reject compiler.

                          Level 1 includes the chasm Luke and Leia 
                          swang across, the elevators Luke, Han, and 
                          Chewie entered on their way to the detention 
                          level, and the large corridor with the 
                          blast doors.  The blueprints covered 1/6 of 
                          the level, so I had to make up the rest.  

                          Level 2 consists of the detention level, the 
                          trash copmactor, and the security station 
                          from the RPG.  I copied some of the sections
                          for deathmatch reasons.  
                          
                                HINT: follow Leia's technique on 
                                      getting to the trash compactor

Known Bugs              : DO NOT SAVEGAME IN LEVEL 2!  The number of
                          vertices, objects, etc. overruns the 
                          savegame buffer.  If you die, it's still
                          possible to finish the level from scratch.
                          Anyways, life in the Doom/Starwars world is
                          supposed to be a bitch! :-)

                          Minor HOM at ends of tunnels in level 2; I
                          trimmed as much detail as I could to bring 
                          this down, and didn't think the remaining 
                          HOM was bad enough to take out any more 
                          detail.  Sorry!  

                          If you find any others, please let me know.
