* Notes *

This WAD is intended as a tool for WAD authors, to give an easy way
to examine animated sprites without getting killed by them!  The
single room contains cages with all 9 different monsters, initially
"asleep".  You can fire into or near the cages to wake up the monsters,
but they can't fire out.  You can move all around the cages to get a
360 degree view.  Try it with the Star Wars* and Aliens* WADs, e.g.:

        doom -file aliens.wad spritzoo.wad -episode 1
