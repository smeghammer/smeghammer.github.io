Description:    A "different" DeathMatch level.

		This level is specifically designed for DEATHMATCH play.
		If you want to experience the ultimate DeathMatch level
		try MEGADETH by this author. It's the best available!

		STARBASE incorporates the use of enhanced weapons.

		Laser sights and MegaViolence mode are independently
		switchable.
		



Story:          The aliens came to Earth on a mission of peace but the
		Pentagon decides to capture their starbase to steal their
		weapons technology. And whilst they're there, why not
		perform some hideous genetic experiments on them too... 

		You will capture the aliens' most advanced weaponry: guns
		with laser sights, silencers and enhanced firepower!



Gameplay:       STARBASE is designed solely for deathmatches although all
		other modes are supported.


Enhanced
Weapons:        STARBASE gives you access to enhanced weapons. These
		incorporate laser sights for the pistol, shotgun and
		chaingun. (Laser sights are optional.)

		The laser sights are not used for the rocket launcher,
		plasma rifle and BFG9000 because these weapons have a blast
		radius and do not need precise aiming.

		The laser sights will auto-dim when you enter darkened areas
		to avoid giving your position away  :))

		Like with the real thing, if you keep the trigger down on
		the pistol, shots will tend to wander after the first one.
		It is best to release the trigger after each shot. This also
		applies to the chaingun. Short controlled bursts of fire are
		most effective.

		For super-enhanced weapons, try MegaViolence mode.




MegaViolence
Mode:           MegaViolence mode only operates with Doom V 1.2. You must also
		ensure you have at least 581 Kb free on your hard disc for the
		installation program to create a backup of DOOM.EXE. This mode 
		gives you access to enhanced super-weapons :))

		In this mode, you have enhanced hand to hand combat, a quick
		-fire auto-pistol, a rapid re-load shotgun, a 2200 rounds
		per minute chaingun, a rapid re-load rocket launcher firing
		super high explosive ammo and a fast-fire plasma gun.
