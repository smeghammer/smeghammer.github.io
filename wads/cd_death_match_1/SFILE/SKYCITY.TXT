                          PLEASE, LET ME KNOW WHAT YOU THINK OF THIS WAD!!
                          
                          I didn't get much feedback last time (is that
                          good or bad?? :) 
                          But, I just want to know if I should bother 
                          making any more..........

Description             : Well, this is my second attempt at a pwad.  I
                          think this one is a little better than my first
                          attempt (which wasn't that bad - toot toot!! :)
                          SKYCITY is just that - A semi-city stuck 1 mile
                          high in the sky.  I created new textures to 
                          simulate the effect.  It has all new wall textures 
                          in it as well as a new sky/floor ...blah blah.....
                          
                          But, PLEASE, run the SKYCITY.BAT file so that
                          you can temporarily put the floor textures into
                          your DOOM.WAD file (yeah, sorry - Can't put new
                          floors into pwads).  But, the batch file takes
                          care of it and will restore the original floors
                          when you're done.  Back it up if you don't trust
                          me :)  
                          I included a .lmp just in case you get a little
                          PO'd trying to find the secrets (They aren't
                          that hard, anyway...)
