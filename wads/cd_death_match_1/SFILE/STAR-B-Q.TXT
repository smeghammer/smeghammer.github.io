Description             : You're invited to a cookout.  But this ain't no
                          picnic!  Prepare to fry some demonic butt as you
                          claw your way out of the Star Chamber to find out
                          what lies beyond.  But keep an eye on your back,
                          or you may be next on the spit!

                          This is one of those infamous "first WAD" attempts.
                          As such it includes the usual hodge-podge of every
                          idea the author ever thought of regarding a DOOM
                          level.  Yes, most anything regarding theme and
                          consistency has been tossed carelessly over the 
                          edge of the abyss, with a spicy mixture of nifty
                          puzzles, neat gizmos and cool structures proudly
                          taking their place.  It ain't French cookin', but
                          it oughta satisfy a hungry Doomer for a meal or 
                          two.  Watch for the baron's BBQ...and there's some
                          fairly amazing graphic textures at the end...if
                          you can make it that far. <8-)
