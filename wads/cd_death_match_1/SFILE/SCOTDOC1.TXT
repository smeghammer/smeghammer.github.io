Description             : This is my first real pwad, however I have practiced.
                          This wad makes you think, at the same time requires
                          skill at the trigger. A perfect combination.  There
                          are a few techniques which I have yet to see in other
                          wads, including a unique ending.  Please, email any 
                          comments or suggestions  to me.  In order to complete 
                          this level on ultra-violence on your FIRST try with
                          no cheats you must be an extremely experienced player
                          with a lot of luck.  
                          Good Luck.
