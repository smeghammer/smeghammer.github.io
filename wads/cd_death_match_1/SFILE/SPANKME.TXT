Misc. Author Info               : Spends far too much time playing Doom 
			  
Description                     : This patch file is for E1M1. This level is designed for DEATHMATCH. There are some monsters if you want them. There is nothing very fancy about this level, its just good clean fraggin' fun. 

Additional Credits to           : Adam Gilchrist and Andy Banks for playtesting.

Additional Notes                : This is an update of ANDYS1ST.WAD which was corrupt. Hope I've got it right this time. Unfortunately its only fragging, not spanking that goes on in this WAD. The man who used to deal in that sort of thing is no longer in the department, along with his computer. You must have heard the gossip.
