The Story:

After a routine period of diplomatic negotiations, you beam back
aboard your starship only to find a body in the transporter room,
and shotguns and shells all over the place!!!

A quick scan of the console reveals your ship is 
under control of some wicked monstrosities from the south side of hell!
Their course : straight to earth, with all weapons locked on!

Can you make it to the bridge and stop the ship from its 
destructive mission?

====================================================================

Notes :

A lot of work went into this WAD. I decided to split it into two
oarts since I was already past 1500 vertices and 2000 segments, and
DEU was begininig to bheave funny (It reported only 60k free memory
at times). Part 1  ends as you make it to the second level
of the saucer section of the ship. Part two will take it up from
there.

Let me know of any comments/suggestions, please.

Thanks, and enjoy!

NACELLE section (furthermost rear of the level)

Once in the TEK room, there is a lift in the southern/western
corner that leads to the second floor with the key.
