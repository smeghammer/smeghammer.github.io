Misc. Brother Info	: Conned into submitting this to the net. I take no
                          responsibility for the contents of this file or the
                          attached wad. That being said, it is a rather good
                          example of the genre - Good design, no HOM,
                          inappropriate or misaligned textures, and very
                          hard >:)
                          Anyway, here it is in the words of the Author...

DESCRIPTION

KILL, KILL, AND KILL SOME MORE.

Puzzle wads really shit me off!! All that happens is you die 30 times trying
to work out what combination to press the buttons (or whatever), and then
never look at it again. I love playing DOOM, and I like new walls
and doors in the same way that I like new scenery. What I had in mind when I 
started designing this level was something to give a challenge to the most
seasoned DOOM player. I believe that I have succeeded.

This level does have it's fair share of tricks and traps, but basically I
see them as just being new ways of introducing beasties onto unsuspecting
(or just complacent) players. Words of warning appear below:

1)      The level gets tough from the word go. Now you can't say that I 
        didn't warn you.

2)      If it looks like a trap, then it probably is. NB - I design traps
        to KILL, not just scare. If you get killed the first time (and you
        probably will), don't get too discouraged. Shit happens.

3)      a big APOLOGY to those people who hate it when wad authors use
        darkness excessively as a way of making mosters nastier. My 
        darkened maze area has been known to piss the play testers off,
        but in consideration of this there are two (2) sets of light amp. 
        goggles available. Both are very hard to get. One is obvious (just 
        don't get killed), and the other is in a secret area that shows   
        up on the computer map.

4)      If you can't find the red key, don't despair - it isn't hidden,
        probably just disguised by monster bodies. Go and have another look.

5)      If you think that it is too hard, then play it on an easier level.
        'Hurt Me Plenty' is about equivalent to standard 'Ultra Violence'.
        Don't feel ashamed - even I die about 50% of the time.
