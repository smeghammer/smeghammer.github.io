GUITAR!, One JAM of a PWAD!!

With the onset of DOOM v1.666 Registered patch,  the eight channel
sound upgrade made this PWAD worth the work.  I have tried here to
duplicate every single noise any of the regular DOOM monsters make
but with a little Stratocaster flare!  This PWAD is just for kicks
and will most probably drive everyone completely insane, but enjoy
it for what it's worth.  If you're still using  DOOM Reg v1.2  you
should seriously consider upgrading to v1.666  as for when you get
too much going on in DOOM,  the 4 channel sound  has a tendency to
clip short  some of the  digitized sounds contained  in this PWAD.
If you're running  Registered v1.666 already,  be sure to get into
SETUP and change to 8 channels in your Sound Card setup! This PWAD
contains only new sounds for ALL of the monsters in DOOM and a bit
of graphic work on the status bar, you'll see.  The equipment used
to create these new sounds (if you're curious) is as follows:
   
              1994 Fender Stratocaster (1968 Reissue)
                      Carvin XT112 Tube Amp
                   DigiTech DSP16 Effects Rack

Have a Rockin' Good Time!,
