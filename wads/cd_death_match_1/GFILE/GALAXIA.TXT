Misc. Author Info     : |~~~~~~~~~| I live in a small town.
                        | |  |~~\ | I spend more time with wad-building now..
			| |__|__/ | I used to play tennis, now I play DOOM :(
			| |  |    | I like beer, chess, techno, demos, Doom,
			| |  |    | travelling, playing cards, computers, GUS,
			|_________| and...
==============================================================================
Description            : - This is my first creation. But I tried to avoid
			   mistakes like too high sector, too long line, HOM,
			   texture misalignment and such ...
			 - It took me many hours and when I finished the level
			   after several weeks, I didn't want to have just a few
			   soldiers. So, this is gonna be tough.
			 - No Cyberdemon, but several spiders. But wait! The one
			   in the first room is here just for the story and will
			   be killed later. All other spiders are only
			   decorations and won't be killed. A few cacos and
			   barons. (total: over 330 enemies)
			 - You will be given all weapons except the BFG.
			 - Don't believe in invulnerability. (It sucks).
			 - There are no traps or places where you would stuck.
			 - No puzzles, just an instant and hard action.
			   Hey, this is DOOM!
			 - My plan was to design an original subway area and
			   sewers. (of course). When I started, I hadn't played
			   a single pwad before. So I didn't steal any idea,
			   just was not first.
			 - THE LEVEL WAS DESIGNED FOR ONE PLAYER ONLY AS A STAND
			   ALONE WAD. PLAY THE LEVEL AND QUIT. YOU SHOULD HAVE
			   A FAST 486 (designed on DX2-66 VLB).
			 - I can complete the level in about 20 minutes.

Additional Credits to   : Everybody who made this possible. (Would be a long
			  list.)
============================================================================

* Play Information *

Episode and Level #     : E1M1 + a tiny level E1M9 (after finishing the first
				level, read the story and load the pwad again,
				and press idclev19 - I don't want you to
				have any ammo. This is THE BERSERK TIME!!
				READ THE STORY for details.
Single Player           : Yes
Cooperative 2-4 Player  : Yes - only Ultraviolence and Hurt me plenty
Deathmatch 2-4 Player   : Yes - only Hey, not too rough!!!!
Difficulty Settings     : Yes (HMP, UV) - play UV anyway, E1M9 has just one
New Sounds              : Yes (8), from various shareware collections and some
                                   of them are my criples
New Music		: No
New Graphics            : Yes (Title screen and SKY1 were scanned, other images
			       were drawn by myself, one of them using original
			       id's wooden texture)
Demos Replaced          : No

* Construction *

Base                    : New level from scratch (Is there anyone who would
			  modify existing levels?)
Build Time              : Three month. O.K., I took a nap, finished exams and
			  did a gazilion other things. May be 200 hours?
Editor(s) used          : DEU 5.1, DEU 5.21gcc, BSP 1.1, BSP 1.2, DMGRAPH,
			  DMAUD, MIDI2MUS, Ted, Advanced Digiplayer v3.0b,
			  IPhotoDeluxe, PhotoStyler, FastTracker, MOD2MID,
			  MIDIsoft Session,			  
Hardware used		: 486DX2-66 VLB, 386DX40, HP ScanJet IIcx, SB 2.0, GUS
Known Bugs              : Bugs? NO! Just drawbacks. One room is a bit slow
			  (127 lines and 55 sprites on the screen), I made
			  the save possible (If you added one other thing,
			  DOOM would hang up.) Now, the machine hangs only
			  when I exit to DOS (using v 1.2). The sky texture
			  is flipped horizontaly, dunno why but I don't care.
			  Ummmmmm, ..... may be not perfect English? :)
                          In DOOM 1.666+ should be NO PROBLEM!!!!!!!!!

==============================================================================
This level was not tested, because people that I know have just 386s, no time
for intensive playing doom and just slight experience with external levels.
Therefore I would really appreciate the feedback.I am opened to your criticism.
If it is not problem for you, record your first try or your best try to let
me see how you think during the game. I NEED IT FOR MY FUTURE WADBUILDING!
Send it zipped and uuencoded on my somewhere above mentioned e-mail address.
I will answer any questions and problems you have.I just want to get your mail.
So don't be lazy and encourage a lonely but still happy DOOMer.


And the last thing:

DO NOT CHEAT, PLEASE! THERE IS NO REASON TO DO IT.  THERE ARE NO MAZES,
IMPOSSIBLE PLACES, TELEPORTERS OR PUZZLES.  YOU GET ENOUGH AMMO TO KILL
EVERYTHING (except those decorative SpiderDemons). DON'T BOTHER TO SAVE
YOUR  GAME AFTER CLEARING  1 SQUARE METER.  THERE ARE  NO TRICKS,  JUST
SURPRISES.  IF YOUR HEALTH IS LOW  AFTER YOU GOT FROM CROSS FIRE, THERE
SHOULD BE A MEDICAL KIT OR A SOUL SPHERE ROUND THE CORNER.


			   THE BEST ACTION IS NON-INTERRUPTED ACTION!!!

==============================================================================

This CD version of GALAXIA.WAD eliminates some  drawbacks  of the version  that
could  be found on  Internet from July 29th 1994.  It was optimized  to be also
a good co-op. wad.  I recommend  to play with  respawning items. I  don't think
anyone  would  want to  play  deathmatch (you  would need very  fast machines),
but if you do, start with -skill 2 -nomonsters.  It  will  limit  the  size  of
playing field with additional columns. And one more  thing... you will not have
access to exit switch, so play with -timer XX (XX..minutes)
I also removed music that caused crashes on DOOM v. 1.666+ and replaced shotgun
sound.
I did some minor touches to it, but you will not probably notice it.
I also built better reject, which I had no idea in the time of building about.
It means the level should be faster now.
==============================================================================
I would like to express my BIG THANKS to all of you who sent me mail and
encouraged me to do some more wad-building. It became my hobby.
And if YOU would like to send me e-mail, don't hesitate, I love getting e-mail.
