Description             : This is my first attempt a building a
                          Level. It is fairly small but fairly
                          difficult in some areas. Please try
                          this level and feed back any constructive
                          comments you may have to the E-mail address
                          above. Look out for LOL2 coming soon, which
                          I hope will have more of a theme.

Additional Credits to   : Thanks to Stuart Grieg, for recommending that
                          I stick with DEU. It made my life easier in
                          the end.

                          Congratulations to Raphael Quinet and Brendon
                          J Wyber, (authors of DEU), for the creating of
                          such a great editor. (Hurry up DEU 6.0 )!!
