Points of Interest      : E1M1 - Hall of the Lava Lord

                             You (and maybe your friends) have climbed
                          to the summit of the Lava Lord's mountain to
                          seek an audience, but is the Lava Lord even
                          there???

                          E1M2 - Fortress of the Lava Lord

                             Penetrating deeper into the Lava Lord's
                          domain you seek out his personal residence.
                          A very seclusive Lava Lord this is, indeed...


                          E1M3 - Crypt of the Lava Lord

                             Apparantly the Lava Lord spends more time
                          stalking his tomb than he does in his comfy
                          chair. At this point, I don't think he wants
                          you around, do you?

Considerations          : These PWADS have been built primarily with
                          Coop or Deathmatch play in mind. They CAN be
                          played Solo, however, there is at least one
                          area in each level that can only be reached
                          by cooperative effort (intended or otherwise).
                          Unless, of course, you cheat, Chicken-Boy...

Special Note            : For those of you that get distressed when you
                          come upon a seemingly unsurmountable number
                          of boss monsters, rest assured that there is
                          a quite easy and painless way to kill them in
                          these levels. This applies to Coop Mode only,
                          for Solo mode you're on your own...

* Construction *
============================================================================

Base                    : New level from scratch
Build Time              : About 1 Week, on and off
Editor(s) used          : HEU v5.21, BSP v1.2x, RMB v2.1
Known Bugs              : Some slight node screwups that aren't
                          readily apparant. Even though these levels
                          were recompiled with BSP 1.2x, some of the
                          structures are a tad chaotic, and you might
                          see the occasional slice thru a wall...
