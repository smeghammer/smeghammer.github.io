LIFTOR for DeathMatch!

With the onset of the most recent upgrade to DOOM v1.666, not only
was the game play sped up, but with eight channel sound, LIFTOR is
ready to blow your mind! This PWAD contains over 100 lifts making
DeathMatch a literal nightmare--sink holes, collapsing stairways,
even entire floors will drop out of from under the player!  When
LIFTOR is set to Ultra-Violence mode, the entire map is infested
with Imps making single play a challenge, and making DeathMatch a
true nightmare! I hope you enjoy your time in LIFTOR and be sure
to note that this PWAD should only be played using DOOM v1.666!

Enjoy,

Vance Andrew Blevins

P.S. To view a heavy DeathMatch v2.0 DEMO (reqs. DOOM v1.666), be
     sure to load LIFTOR by typing DOOM -FILE LIFTOR.WAD and wait
     a few moments after the opening screen.

Description             : With over 100 separate lifts, need I
                          say anything more? LIFTOR was though
                          created with DOOM v1.666 allowing you
                          Eight Channel sound and DeathMatch v2.0
                          for proper play and desired effect.
