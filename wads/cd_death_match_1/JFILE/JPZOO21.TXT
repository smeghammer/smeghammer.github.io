Description             : Welcome to the Zoo.
                          In the "Too Young" skill, I finished the level
                          in 25 minutes (no die, one save). 
                          The most difficult thing is to found my face 
                          in a texture and the word written on it (Windows
                          Wingdings font coded). 
                          Every next level will contains a new word. 
                          Putting all the words together makes a sentence  
                          about hope ;-)
                          You can exit this level without founding 
                          the face (!)
                          Warning: A second face (beta tester) is present,   
                          but no word on it. 
                          
                          E-mail me the word you founded and how (not 
                          with an editor!). 
                          I'll E-mail to the first five players the next   
                          level (today under construction). 
                          
                          E-mail bugs and suggestions. 
                          
                          I hope you'll enjoy...
