Jailbait is a rather large level in which you start out in jail and have
to fight your way out. Because of many of the narrow ledges and surprise
confrontations I think it probably a pretty challenging level (but great
fun). Take heart, I have gotten through several times on the hardest 
level without dying (but I know where everything is). The medium level is
the same minus the bulls (or centaurs).

As you will notice, there are a couple of minor errors in this level. 
Nothing that takes away from or interferes with the game, but being a
perfectionist they still bug me. I either could not figure out how to get
rid of the problem or it would have taken 5 frustrating more hours to fix it.

Embarrassingly, I don't know how long this level took to make. I lost track 
at about 50 hours, when it was maybe halfway done. But this is my first level,
and I was starting from scratch, and DEU does take a lot of getting used to. 
Which reminds me, any of you frustrated DEU editors, feel free to email 
me with some questions or problems. There are some very specific things 
you need to know about DEU that the manual fails to mention, 
namely lindef defining. I don't want anyone to spend all those frustrating
hours trying to solve a problem when someone else might know the answer.

I really want to hear feedback on this level, suggestions for improvement,
bug fixing suggestions, etc., so please email me at 

trobbins@autobahn.calpoly.edu.

You will enjoy this level - I guarantee it!
