If you like killing Monsters.. This one's for you...
Lots of Monsters means you need lots of CPU power...
It may seem hard to complete but it can be done...
If you need a clue leave me a message on The Game Board, Atlanta GA...
I call almost every day...

Happy Killing.. and good Luck...

Greg Mims...
