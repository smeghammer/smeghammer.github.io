About the level:

Yes, I know, "another house."  Well, it was an exercise in
cuteness, an experiment in adaptation, and an attempt at creating
a neat level with good texture mapping.

This level can be played like any regular DOOM level.  Provisions
have been made for cooperative and deathmatch play.  It's big,
but there's a way to quickly check several areas without running
around.  I'll leave it up to you to find it.

Strategies vary depending on the difficulty level selected.  It
is possible to defeat the enemies on each level with the weapons
provided.  If you are playing multiplayer and want a wide weapon
selection, play on the easy level.  If you want to limit the
weapons selection, play on harder levels.

Hope you enjoy it.  Address any comments/bug reports to:
