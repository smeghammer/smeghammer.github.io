Misc. Author Info       : Ummmm...

Description             : Well, this is the fourth level of mine.
                          I think it is better than the others, 
                          mainly in that the construction is more 
                          complex sice I switched to DEU...  Umm...
                          lessee, It's fun to play alone, but it's 
                          even better with one or more "friends"
                          for cooperative or :) deathmatch..
                          It's called the mazeworks because there are
                          three seperate mazes, none too complex, but
                          one with some walls that won't be on the
                          map... have fun with that one.
                          Also included is a PWAD called sounds,
                          which makes some minor sound changes to
                          the "Demon Soldiers"... use it if you like,
                          but I didn't want to force it on everyone
                          who played the level...

Additional Credits to   : id, for making DOOM.
                          All the wad makers whose ideas have 
                          inspired me...
                          Mark Klem, for the ending sound clip
                            ("Time to die, friend!") originally
                            a part of his replacement for 
                            episode 2 - Cringe!
