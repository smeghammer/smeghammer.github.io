Misc. Author Info       : <ack!>

Description             : Kronos was begun in early April, and due to a
                          hard disk crash and a QIC-80 tape error, lost
                          for several weeks, during which DEU 5.1 was
                          released. (And no, I didn't have a second
                          backup.) The tape decided on it's own to work
                          for just one pass 4 days ago, and I did manage
                          to recover the most of my Doom files. <sigh>

                          Kronos is a puzzle, although not a difficult
                          one. Beware of doors opening behind you!
