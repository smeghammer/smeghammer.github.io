Description             :       The leaders of the Federation anticipating
                          the possibility of an assult by the Denziens of Hell
                          have constructed a training facility. The facility
                          has been stocked with all weapons and plenty of ammo
                          to train a marine in the use of various firepower.
                                The Federation has also simulated, to the best
                          of their knowledge, various beasts. Little is known
                          about the creatures, so there might be more 
                          formidable foes awaiting in the real attack. 
                                The facitlity was built on the premise that 4 
                          marines could simulate battle with each other, 
                          because the limited knowledge of the beasts makes 
                          for them to be rather predictable opponents.

                                This is version 2.0 of my TRAINING.WAD. I
                          modified it a little for the new respawning items
                          in Deathmatch 2.0. I also added a few Multi-only
                          items and a couple more monsters. Nothing special.
