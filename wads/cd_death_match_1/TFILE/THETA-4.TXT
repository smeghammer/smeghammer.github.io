Description: 

Due to the imposing evil forces that presently inhabit the Earth, the United
Federation of Space Marines (UFSM) have set up an isolated training ground 
hidden away in mountains of Tibet. What was once a peaceful shrine dedicated
to meditation of Tibetan monks, THETA-4 (Territorial Human-to-Human Earth 
Training Area) has been converted into a highly active centre for the 
training of Marine recruits. 

The THETA series training grounds specializes in battles that are strictly 
marine vs. marine, since it has been shown in the past that there have been
a number of cases where platoons have been completely wiped out by one of 
their own "former" marines, due to possession. Like all the other THETA's,
marines will fight each other, not other monsters (there are none).

Scenario 1:

Even the Tibetan Shrines, tucked away high atop the tallest mountains in the 
world, could not escape the evil that was unleashed upon Earth. Before the 
shrine could be used as a training area, it had to first become secured
and free from all Evil. Your goal is to secure the area, either alone or
with a team. You will be dropped in through the central roof, behind the
backs of the enemy. Other weapons have been air-dropped around the level for 
your benefit, and it is rumoured that Tibetan guerillas, during the revol- 
ution several years ago, once kept a small stash of weaponry hidden in each 
shrine, including this one. Good luck!

Scenario 2:

In the five days following the securing of the shrine, THETA-4 was prepared
for training, with all toxins, carcasses and other forms of evil removed. 
Your goal is simple - eliminate all other opponents. You have every weapon 
at your disposal, yet to get to each one may not be easy. You also have the
choice to play with the shrine containing only weapons (ie only those items
which will not disappear) or with the place littered with every kind of item 
and weapon imaginable. To exit the level you must cooperate.

PLEASE NOTE:
============

         - Here's a breakdown of what's included for each skill level:

     Skill    Scenario   Comments
     =======================================================================
     1        2          No items that disappear, only weapons (recommended)
     2        2          (same as above)
     3        2          Weapons and LOTS of items
     4        1          Monsters, weapons and some items
     5        1          (same as above)

        - For single player games, the exit button is between two BLUE
          torches. This exit is unreachable during multiplayer games.

        - For multiplayer games, the exit button is between two RED
          torches. 2 players must cooperate in order to get to the exit.

        - This level was designed to be a Deathmatch level - there are no
          toxic areas where the opponent can kill himself. 
          
        - The level is riddled with ambushes and snipers spots. For example,
          the stairs leading from the doors at the beginning have a little 
          nook near them. The trick is to open the door, and hide in the nook.
          The opponent will notice (or hear) the door opening, then proceed
          in that direction, up the stairs, right past you. This will give
          you a perfect shot in the back.
        
        - It is possible to get ALL the weapons without cheating. Actually,
          I kind of give it away in the demo, so look there if you're unsure.
