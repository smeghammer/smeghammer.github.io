Misc. Author Info       Okay Boys & Girls this my second wad and like the 
                        Star Wars saga (It's Not the first Level) at least 
                        not for me. I Hope to have at least 26 more levels 
                        (thats right 26) to add to this one.This maybe (and 
                        do mean MAYBE!!!) level 4 of this set. It "HAD" alot 
                        of bugs in it but I think I got'em all. I have to 
                        thank my friends for that. (see credits below)... 
                        GOOD LUCK!!     (you'll NEED IT!)


Description             The BIG BOYS of hell make another go of it by building
                        a tower that goes for Earth to hell and back 
                        (my own idea for DOOM!II Not that I'm not looking 
                        forward to ID's release).  You, a highly skilled dog 
                        of war, **at least you should be by now*** are armed 
                        With nothing but your own skills and want for 
                        REVENGE!!, must see your way into the few rooms of 
                        this Monolith of Death, but beware the lords of Hell 
                        made sure you had to push the right buttons to get 
                        from level to level.
 
                        So you set out to find the SCUMBAGS!! who took the 
                        lives of your men. Even if It takes you to HELL and 
                        back!!!!

* Construction *

Base                     New level from scratch
Editor(s) used           DEU5.2 , BSP (node builder) 
                             and viewed with 
                               Doom master 2.1
Known Bugs              The only bug I know of is a hall of mirrors 
                        effect when you enter the first room, but that
                        is because of the 16 sidedef rule and I didn't
                        have the heart to change it  (sorry!!!)
