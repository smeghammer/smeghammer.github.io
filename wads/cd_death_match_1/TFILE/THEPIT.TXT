        I made this wad because I am sick of trying to play DeathMatch on 
giant levels where you end up looking around for the other player for 15 min.
and when you finaly find him, its over in one second because you both have the 
rocket launcher.  This level is only made for deathmatch, its not to exciting,
just an elevator, some stairs, some pillars, and a pit with a ledge.  The only
weapons on this level are the shotgun and the chaingun (because they're the 
funnest to kill your friends with).  I think its funnest to play to 20 frags.  
I have had a lot more fun playing DeathMatch with this wad than any other.  
Its simple, but fun.
