Misc. Author Info       : This guy spends way too much time playing
                          DOOM.  He needs to skydive a bit more, and                            
                          graduate!

Description             :   Night has finally fallen, and all Hell has broken 
                          loose!  You wake up in a pool of blood watching
                          your buddy get tortured... You'll put an end to
                          that!  Watch out as you go outside, and collect
                          everything needed to open the last door that leads
                          to a safe place to wait for sunrise.
                            Some doors are opened by a switches, test out 
                          the machine near the end, and save often!  The 
                          temple of demons is a good place to save as well.

Additional Credits to   : Tom Davis for his help in designing the temple
                          Rhet Turnbull for giving suggestions about the
                          alter, and for doing all the pre-alpha testing.
