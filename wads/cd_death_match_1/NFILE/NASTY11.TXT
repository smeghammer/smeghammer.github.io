Description             : A nice/nasty deathmatch with the big weapons

			  (rocket/plasma) being easy to get to, but *VERY*

			  hard to use to any effect (ie. you can't see

			  where you're shooting).  Lots of frags, lots of

			  shooting people in the back.


			  There isn't a level exit, so don't look for one.
