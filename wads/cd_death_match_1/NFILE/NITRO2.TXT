                          and he will pass them on to me.
 
Description             : My Second WAD. Designed for single player, multiple
                          player or Deathmatch modes (has 5 start points). All
                          creatures appear in all dificulty levels.
 
Playing Hints           : There is a switch that doesn't look like a switch.
                        : My suggestion is get the keys in this order, Yellow
                          Red, Blue. That way you would have covered all the
                          areas needed to get the next key, and so on..
                        : Where there is a "switch or trigger point" to turn 
                          the light off, there is another to turn the light on
                        : There are a few sets of steps that are ONE way. That
                          sometimes makes it "sticky" to go the right way. 
                          This is not a bug.
                        : If you get stuck and can't work out what to do, have
                          a look at the demo file.

Although this level is not "massive" like some that I've seen, hopefully it
will be a little more enjoyable.  My theory is, Quality rather than Quantity.
Some of the wad's I've played are massive and their maps look nice (ie form
a shape or object), but due to it's size the authors don't seem to spend 
enough time working on the small details, ie when a door opens the sides 
should not move. etc etc. Also aligning the wall textures when moving over 
uneven surfaces.  Now I'm no expect, this is only my second Wad, but I felt 
I should just mention the above.

Also I don't really worry about players that choose difficulty levels under
Ultra Violent. My thoughts are if they are prepared to play around with add
on levels, then they should be fairly fluent and interested in DOOM.  Well I
don't have any users that play DOOM under UV anyway.  If you find that I 
should incorporate lower levels then just let me know.

Hope you enjoy it as much as I had fun making it.
