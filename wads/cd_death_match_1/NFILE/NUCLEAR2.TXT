Misc. Author Info       : 

Note:                   : This replaces NUCLEAR.WAD, the only difference
                          is that this one has a built-in demo.

Description             : This level has a little bit of everything
                          to it.  Wide-open cavernous areas, hidden
                          corridors, good observation/sniper spots,
                          numerous nooks and crannies to ambush/be
                          ambushed in, and a river of poisoned water.
                          The level is built around a nuclear reactor
                          core.

                          During multi-player play, the exit requires
                          co-operation between two players to end the
                          level.  

                          This PWAD also features a few puzzles/tricks
                          that DO NOT need to be solved to complete the
                          level.  In fact, there are entire areas that
                          do not need to be visited to complete the
                          level.

                          DEMO1 has been replaced with a demo of this
                          level done on Hurt Me Plenty.  The demo does
                          not reveal the location of all secrets.

Additional Credits to   : Dina Sweeny-Katkansky, my wife, who
                          provided help with playtesting.

                          Chainsaw Jim, who provided playtesting and
                          numerous suggestions.

                          I couldn't have done it without Jim and
                          Dina's help.
