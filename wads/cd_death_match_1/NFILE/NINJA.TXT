Greetings, fellow doomsters, and welcome to my first ever Doom level, 
created with DEU, that little wonder of a program...
(Now if they could only fix that Hall of Mirrors trouble...^_^ {sigh)

ANYway, I hope you like this first effort, because I'm already working
on the second one, and I just can't deal with rejection...;-)

Oh, by the way, the Email address' is not mine, cuz I ain't got no
internet axis, know wut I mean? It's my roomate, and he's been kind
enough to let me use it to post this, so I give him a big mental hug.

There.

Description: 

Chinese folklore has it that Hell is a maze, where one is given a final
choice: Red, or Black?
(Taken from a french comic book called: The Mad Monk)

Beign a sucker for mazes, I really wanted to create a 3d one for my 
favourite PC game. While this is still a far cry from a real 3d one
(Doom engine forbid), being really a two-level maze (3-level in one part),
it is the closest I came to my original vision, which was similar to the 
vision of Hell presented in Hellraiser II (a badly acted film that had
amazing art direction), that of a maze of narrow galleries surrounded
by deep, deadly pits full of atrocities.

The name Ninja refers to what state of mind you need to complete this
level: silent, deadly, lurking in shadows high above, crossing tightropes
without a sweat, etc., etc. If you can do this level with a joystick, then
you know you've got a good, precise one!
