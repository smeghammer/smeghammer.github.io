Description             : My first WAD.  Designed for single player, multiple 
                          player or Deathmatch modes (has 5 start points). All
                          creatures appear in all dificulty levels.
 
                          It's map size is limited due to it's construction 
                          being done with the Shareware Version of DMapedit.

Playing Hints           : A Door that does not look like a door or a wall 
                          but does look like it's used for support!
                          
Additional Credits to   : Raymond Jennings for the DOOMinspiration and 
                          testing of this level.

Well this is my first attempt at designing and producing a Wad file, so I've
yet to pickup the "tricks" to doing some of the more interesting effects.
If you have any comments, suggestions or criticism please let me know.
 
Hope you enjoy it as much as I had fun making it.
