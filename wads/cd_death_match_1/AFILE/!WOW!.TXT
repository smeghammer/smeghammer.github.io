Description             : This is the chilling finale to The Shores
			  of Hell, but with a few extra twists.
			  There are many more enemies and things
			  to figure out.  There is an entire section
			  that cannot be reached without TWO people
			  playing.  Here is a warning... Even on the 
			  easiest skill setting, this level will be 
			  challenging.  Here's another warning... 
			  I created this level on a 90 MHz Pentium
			  with 16 Meg of memory.  There are loads and
			  loads of enemies running around.  I do not 
			  recommend playing this level on your old
			  386.  My 486 66 with 32 Meg of memory was 
			  even a little sluggish. I am happy to tell you
			  that I just completed the original music
			  for this level-- my sequencing software is crummy!
