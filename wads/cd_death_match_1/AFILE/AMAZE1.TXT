Description             :This started out as an experiment in learning DEU,
                        and just grew into this .WAD file.  It's got a 
                        little of everything a new DEU user would need to
                        spend time figuring out, different doors, wall
                        textures, steps, lifts and more.  It's meant to
                        replace Episode 1, Map 1, so there ain't no
                        Cacodemons, rocket launchers or instant death traps,
                        if you're into that stuff you'll need to wait for
                        my next effort...  ;)

Additional Credits to   :My wife, for putting up with me dragging into bed
                        at 3 a.m humming the Doom tune; Steve Bareman for
                        re-writing the DEU docs to where I could *almost*
                        understand them, and for netmailing me the rest of
                        what I couldn't figure out; Brendon Wyber and Raphal
                        Quintet for a decent Doom editor at an *extremely*
                        reasonable price; id Software for their twisted
                        outlook on life and the good sense to write it
                        into a program; and mostly, the helpful hands on
                        alt.games.doom who answered many newbie questions.

*Copyrights / Permissions *

Hey, the editor was free, I looked at just about every .WAD file out there
to figure out how to do things, and I had a ball doing it.  If I were to
restrict or copyright this in any way the spirit would be lost.  Besides,
if you claim this as your work I figure you'll eventually rot in your own
personal hell...  (Me, I'll be hanging out in Hell on Earth...)
