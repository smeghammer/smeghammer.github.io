Misc. Author Info       : 2 guys with patience and obsession.  Many
                          testing hours in modem and single user
                          play.  Yeah, it was *testing* ... 
                          that's what it was!

Description             : This is the first of a series of levels, some
                          of which are completely revamped levels first
                          released as Sacrifice levels 1-6 for DOOM I.
                          These levels offer sophistication and 
                          puzzle solving rather than just turning
                          up the volume.  Children (you know who 
                          you are) may be bored.  Definite consideration
                          was given to consistency, theme and fairness.
                          However, you should remember that these are
                          levels for DOOM II, and that presupposes that
                          you are an experienced player.

                          making such a creative endeavor possible;
                          all those who have made other tools and 
                          nifties that make things a lot easier.

* Description *

Map 1 Description       : "Argus"
                          Argus refers to the Greek mythological creature
                          used by Hera to watch over Io.  You'll "see"
                          what we mean.

                          Several separate puzzles; be careful not to get 
                          overanxious.  Brains are better than brawn.  
                          Visual clues are important.


* Construction *

Base                    : Originally a new DOOM I level from scratch, 
                          vastly redone and added to with new DOOM II 
                          textures, monsters and features.  Was part 
                          of the "Sacrifice" WAD series.

Editor(s) used          : DEU 5.0 through 5.21+, plus BSP 1.2x

Known Bugs & Limitations: None that we caused (we hope).

* Philosophy *

Appearance/Design       : A lot of effort was put into making things look
                          good.  After your killing spree is over, take the
                          time to look around.  Several levels have some 
                          vantage points with grand vistas (or at least as
                          grand as the DOOM engine would allow).  If you 
                          want to see how fast you can get done, fine.  Then
                          go back with the -nomonsters switch and just look.

                          Not everything has a purpose.  Some things are
                          just there for artistic or architectural interest.
                          We think that is one of the things that made the
                          original DOOM levels so good.  

Traps                   : All levels were intentionally made so you should
                          not get trapped irreversibly (though you may die 
                          learning how to get out).  Please let us know if
                          you end up stuck in a place you wouldn't think
                          you'd fit.  We tried to be _real_ careful about
                          this.

Secret Areas            : You should not have to get into all secret areas
                          to complete a level.  Keys or switches to open
                          main path doors or areas should not be located in
                          secret areas.  

                          All secret doors should be slightly different or
                          highlighted in a way that a casual stroll through
                          the area (as opposed to a 70MPH screaming streak)
                          should allow you to find them.  You should _not_
                          have to resort to pushing everything in sight.
                          However, if you miss Wolfenstein, go on and push.

                          Secret doors will not show up on the map.  Sorry,
                          but if we allowed that, we wouldn't need to make
                          them subtly different, and that wouldn't be as 
                          much fun.  For either of us.  Sometimes you'll get
                          a computer map, and that will usually show the 
                          areas.  But we'll hide that map in a secret area,
                          so you'll still have to use the little gray cells.

Monsters                : We prefer a few sneaky ones to a roomful that
                          makes you prefer a date with Godzilla.  This also
                          means that once you learn our levels, they become
                          easier to play.  Don't like that?  Go Nightmare.
                          That'll teach you.

                          Levels were all built for Ultraviolence (skill 4).
                          Then some of those bad & good things were changed
                          for the lower levels (2 & 3--level 1 is the same
                          as 2 except the goop doesn't hurt as bad).  Some
                          areas are differently populated (different
                          critters) and others are less densely populated
                          with the same critters.  Whatever seemed 
                          appropriate.  Sometimes "easier" levels just get
                          more health and ammo, or guns are more readily
                          available.  Since the original design was for
                          UV, you'll probably get the best total feel for
                          what we built if you play at that level.  Of 
                          course, you have to live that long...
