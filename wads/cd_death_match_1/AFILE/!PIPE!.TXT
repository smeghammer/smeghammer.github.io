Description             : Here is your chance to take a lovely tour
                          of the subterranian sewer system that exists
                          to fulfil all of Hell's waste disposal needs.
                          But what is that coming out of the pipe?! 
                          I guess it is time to take out the trash!
                          Mangle the monsters, clean the sewers out,
                          explore horrific ventilation shafts and find the
                          pipe that will bring you back to the surface.

                          For all of you thrill seekers out there, try 
                          ULTRAVIOLENCE... You will have a little trouble
                          getting down the first pipe, but after that
                          it will be smooth sailing, yea right!  

                          A warning to anyone who thinks they are cool and
                          anyone who downloads a wad file, then uses IDDT
                          IDDQD and IDKFA and breezes through the wad.  
                          You will be pleasently surprized by this wad file.
                          I put a few IDDT busters in there for all the 
                          cheaters of the world to be discouraged with.

                          Be warned.  I am a crafty bastard.  This Wad file
                          is a bitch and there are many chances to die, so
                          die and have fun doing so.  There is a demo included
                          It is the SECOND demo, so wait for it.

                          For all you network jocks out there...

                          This level was designed for CO-OP play.  
                          Deathmatch starts have been inserted, but
                          Deathmatch sucks with this level.  There
                          is a great possibility that one or more
                          players will get stuck someplace.  And a greater
                          possibility that any player will never see any
                          of the other players. Go CO-OP for this one.

Base                    : New level from scratch
Editor(s) used          : DEU 5.21, BSP 1.2
Known Bugs              : The room with three pipes has a slight node
                          error that BSP couldn't handle.  In each of 
                          the rooms with two pipes, you can see the 
                          Cacodemons as they are rising through slight
                          nodes errors.  In the rooms where you have
                          to shoot the Skull buttons, there may be a 
                          slight nodes error, but that is not definate.
                          In the last room you can walk on the toxic waste
                          and get to a spot where the entire screen turns
                          green.  That is pretty cool, but an error!
                          Some monsters regain their hearing.  The lift
                          near the end gets you stuck sometimes because the
                          monsters set it off.  The music sometimes just
                          cuts out.  The demo does not complete the level.
                          (It was such a pain in the ass to make that damn
                          thing!!!!)
                          
                          *** This may look like a big bunch of errors, 
                              but this level is still quality.  You won't 
                              even notice! ***
