Description             : Well, I was all set for another
                          boooring day at the office, but

* Construction *

Base                    : New level from scratch
Editor(s) used          : DEU 5.0, 5.1, & 5.2 GCC (bigtime!)
Known Bugs              : I am aware of several small flaws,
                          however these do not affect gameplay,
                          IMHO.  The level has grown quite
                          large; I have tried to be a perfec-
                          tionist and have failed in several
                          locations;  Also I'm really tired of
                          continually improving it!  :)  I've
                          decided to release this and perhaps
                          create an update level in the near
                          future.
Disclaimer              : Inasmuch as I think I am aware of
                          the inherent flaws in this release,
                          I do think you will find this level
                          to be impressively complete and visually
                          stunning (toot toot).  I hope you enjoy
                          playing through...  (fore!!!   <boom>).
