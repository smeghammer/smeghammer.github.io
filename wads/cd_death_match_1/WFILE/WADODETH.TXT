Description             : DEATHMATCH! DEATHMATCH! DEATHMATCH!
			  This will challenge even the most experienced Death
			  Match players. Play revolves around a courtyard with
			  a Pyramid of Death. (called this because if you want
			  the rocket launcher, you must ascend to the top.
			  Not easy when someone is shooting at you!) Also 
			  included are two 'prison cells' to which you shall be
			  teleported if you cross the wrong portion of a tele-
			  porter line. Once inside.. you are fair game to all..
			  In order to give the teleporters a fell of randomness,
			  I split the line def into smaller segments so that 
			  crossing at one point might send you to the top of 
			  the pyramid.. but it might send you to the prision
			  or to the trench at the base of the pyramid (which
			  also has a teleporter line to the prision) 
			  ****************************************************
			  ***I strongly urge you to play with Respawn..There
			  are a few sergeants who can help you if both players
			  wind up in jail..***

Build Time              : 1 Week
Editor(s) used          : DEU521GCC, BSP12X, WACKERB7
Known Bugs              : None! (had to work at getting rid of HOM)

I wanted more in the courtyard but too many visible 2-sided line defs created
the HOMly effect.. (Pyramid has a lot of lines). All of the teleporters have
multiple destinations. You CAN wind up near the top of the pyramid BUT you are
taking a risk.. You might also wind up in the prison! (great fun!) Let me know
what you think.. Comments are welcome!
