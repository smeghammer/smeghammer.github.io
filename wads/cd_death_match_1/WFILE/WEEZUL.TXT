	The story so far... Your squad was shipping out. Back to
the world of women and real food. The Company medTechs put you
in your iron maiden, slang for the cold sleep capsule, and off
to dream land you went. Things were just getting good when you
wake up suddenly. It's dark. The gravity is still Mars norm. 
There's no steward there with stimulants to ease the wake.
There's no sargeant there to shake your rack. In fact... all
you can see from your capsule is that everything in the cargo
storage area is weird. Like you are looking at it from some
kind of funhouse mirror. 

  	You open the tube and step onto the cold floor expecting
that shock as usual. But it's not cold. In fact the floor is
very warm. And the air smells even worse than usual, if that's
possible. Nothing tastes quite like air that's been belched, 
farted and recycled and few thousand times. But this is nasty.
It's something you have smelled before. Death. Old, rotting,
someone burn me type of death. Standing there in your birthday 
you take your pistol out from the locker and check to see it's
loaded. Don't leave home without it!

  	Stepping out into the room you step in something gooey
and slip. In the flickering light you see to your horror what's
left of Johansonn. Disembowelled. Twisted. Sickening. That's it. 
Someone's gonna pay. No.. check that... someTHING's going to
pay. You see a creature eating bits of a corpse. It doesn't pay 
attention to you. Like a big, pink, hairless ape. Only with
a maw big enough to swallow your rucksack whole. Looking around
you see the whole structure has changed. Like some force has
taken the base and twisted it. The walls have bizarre graffiti
of them in a hundred languages. Obscene pictures depicting acts
so depraved and disgusting that even your legendary stash of
porn vids pales in comparison. And lots of dead things. Dead
friends.... dead monsters all of descriptions. 

 	Well. Now you need a plan. Let's see. I don't fly. I don't
breathe vacuum too good. And I can't call for help because I -AM-
the help. OK. Guess it's time to kill sumfin. Hey varmint!! Check
this out! The Nasty beastie looks at you and bellows a pained cry
while charging at an impossibly fast rate. You pump 15 round into
his skull before the lifeless body crashes out of control into the
deck. Twitching and flopping. You hear the sounds of machinery
working and scream of tortured men. Are some of your buddies still
alive? 

 	After exploring the room you see Corporal Beilecki move. 
And then he stands up. Only his guts fall out through a 2 foot
gash in his stomach. The rotting corpse smiles and raises his
rifle to shoot you. You shoot him first. 8 or 9 times. Hell...
I guess I'm in the Excorcist part 9 or something. God help me.
Huh. Well... Heckler & Koch help me!!! I'll find some hardware
and clean house. 

so begins mission 1, Mourning at Marsbase

	Following the trail of bodies outside you find that
the landscape of Mars has changed. There is a real atmoshpere now.
It still stinks though so you keep the helmet sealed and the 
recycler on. The other buildings look strange. So what else is new. 
You've just seen some things that make your ex-wife seems sweet
and innocent. And blasted them into steaming shreds. Now... to 
check out the crew quarters. Maybe there's someone left alive there.
Or some food that hasn't been corrupted. Or a laxative. Been
12 hours and you still can't piss. Must be powerfull sick. 

so begins mission 2, Lair of the Weezul

	Now I get it. This is hell. I'm not on Mars...I'm in
hell. Did I die and not figure it out yet? If so there got
to be a bunch of pissed off demons wondering how my shotgun 
still works! <G> The blasted landscape is just what you expect,
badlands covered with steaming, sulphur smoke. Lava pits. Mounds
of rotting corpses. Guess I won't be crapping ever again. Might
as well get used to it. Eventually you see a stairway down into
a sheltered canyon. It looks nicer than the blasted surface anyhow.
Down you go along the long marble stairway until a wall slams down
behind you. Ah.... I see. Welcome to my house. OK. Who wants some?
You say aloud as you jack the slide of your Mossberg. A sickening
drunken looking fortress rises from the mists and you hear more of
the grunts and screams you have been getting -not- so used to.

so begins mission 3, House of Pain

        That big sucker almost got you before sneaking through
his house and nabbing the skull key. Too bad you couldn't find
a BFG9K... would toasted him too! But how long can you go on like
this. Well. We'll see! After what seems like forever you see
a normal looking structure. You immediatly reason that it must
be a trap of some sort as nothing here is normal! Another butt-
kickin party! 

so begins mission 4, Fountain of Blood

    	That was disssssgusting. Having to swin in that blood
pool to fish out the key.

so begins mission 5, Shrine of Hell

	The seven gates of hell? There were only 6! Some baron
of hell <G> must have choked several node builders putting
those arches up. I bet he used BSP1.1 to do it. I bet if you
check it out with the verify level features of DoomCAD or
DEU5.21 you get 'this is screwed!' But it works. hehe.

.... many more to come.
