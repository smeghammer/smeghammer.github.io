Description             : A medium sized level with lots of sargents, imps,
                          a few demons, and a cacodemon or 2. All 3 keys 
                          will be needed. Plenty of ammo can be found, some 
                          in secret areas. A few trap doors, and automatic
                          opening rooms. Not an easy level.
