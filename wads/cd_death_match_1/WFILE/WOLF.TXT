Misc. Author Info       : Currently enlisted in the USAF.
                          Assigned to Langley AFB, VA.
                          Used to attend Univ. of Arkansas, Fayetteville.
                          Was on some of the first MUDs/LPMUDS in the
                          states as Biggles or Cthulhu.
                          That's quite enough about me. :-)
Description             : This is a rework of the classic first
                          level of Wolfenstein 3D.  (e.g You've
                          been captured.  You start out in a
                          dungeon cell, next to the still warm
                          corpse of a guard. However, this time
                          it's a key instead of a gun that you
                          start with. (Made more sense.)  From
                          there, it plays like WOLF3D. (I hope.)
                          One thing to keep in mind, however:
                          If you're playing cooperative mode,
                          you're the only one with a key, so
                          you really should let your buds out. :-)
                          
                          --> Please play through on one of the
                              other skill levels (preferably
                              'Bring em on') before playing
                              through on Ultra-Violence. The
                              lower skill levels are the Wolf
                              tribute, and UV is my... twist
                              on it. :^)  Good luck, and I'd
                              appreciate it if you'd drop me
                              a line with any comments.

                           really like apple pie that much.
                           you get the picture.

                          I haven't dug TOO deeply since the recompile with
                          DEU 5.21.  Didn't seem to be any HOM errors, so
                          I didn't use BSP on the 5.21 compile.

(Too big as it is, really. Runs well on my 386/40, at low detail, but
I had to cut down on the beasties.)
