Description             : This is a very small wad, but it´s extremely hectic 
			  with three or four players. No extra ammo, just 
			  pick up your weapons and kill your friends. You 
			  are bound to get hit yourself, so you may have to 
			  commit suicide in the two suicide pits. Hint: play 
			  the wad until one of the players has, say, 10 or 15 
			  kills. (That should take about 10 mins.) Then exit 
			  and restart.
