This started off as a .WAD of the building where I work, but that started
to get a bit boring so I added some extra bits.  For example, there is
no teleporter in the car park in real life, and there were no spectres in
the mens toilets last time I looked.

I have incuded a .LMP of myself doing the level with 100% kills and secrets
at ultraviolence skill level.  If anyone can do it at nightmare I would like
to know!

The level was designed using Deu 5.0 with BSP 1.1 to join the edges
together.  It seems there is a glitch near the end where the screen is
blanked out with strange patterns when you cross certain linedefs.  If
anyone knows the reason for this, I would like to know.

I hope you enjoy this level.
