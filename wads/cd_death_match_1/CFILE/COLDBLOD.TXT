Description             : This is for solo play only.  The next level in
			  Wads.  Problem solving and skills are needed.
			  
	     	    	  You are in a four story building and things just
			  don't seem right.  You have had it with this place.
			  All you can think about is getting back home and
			  downing a Samuel Adam's cream stout.  
			  
			  
			  
Additional Credits to   : First off my wife, a doom widower.  Also a 
			  special thanks goes to Tom Doyle (TDdoyle)
			  for his great help and suggestions.
			    
			  The authors of DoomCad and ID software. 
			  I want my Quake!
