Misc. Author Info       : To try and satisfy my Doom addiction I figured I
			  would make some of new levels.  Often these
			  levels tend to be good for deathmatch.  Let me 
			  know what you think via e-mail.

Description             : This level is set in 5 basic sections.  One is open
			  aired, with some platforms.  One is a maze with 
			  some nice sniping points.  The exit room has two
			  sides.  If you can figure it out, there is a great
			  trap to kill your opponent in deathmatch.  It may
			  take some doing, but the result is well worth it.
			  There is also one large secret room with a wide
			  selection of baddies to mop up, as well as 
			  numerous treats.

I would also like to thank Rapha‰l Quinet and all those who worked with
him, for making available DEU 5.21 (and previous versions).  Without this
great editor, this pwadfile would not have been possible.

I would like to thank ID Software for creating Doom, without it I would have
far too much free time on my hands.  Now if they can just figure out a way
for me to get college credit for playing!
