Description             : Fairly mean level. A few nasty surprises.
                          Generally fun. A few big rooms. A tall
                          tower. Lots of monsters. Lots of weapons.
                          Thrills. Chills. Darkness.

This level was the first major one I made. The first big room was kind of
cardioid-shaped, so cardioid, cardiac, Cardiac Arrest!  You'll know when
you get there. I played with opening sectors, doors, stairs, lifts, switches,
the whole works.  Getting from the start room to the first room is somewhat
tricky. Getting out of the cardioid room is somewhat tricky. Getting to the
top of the tower in the second big room is somewhat tricky too, but worth it.
Getting through the third big room is easier than it looks. Then just slug
it out to the end. I have a .LMP recorded with 1.666 available, if anyone
is curious. Saving is a good idea.

Some of the textures are intentionally sloppy, so that secret doors are
somewhat obvious. I don't think any sectors are tagged as secret, so
no secrets will show up at the end. If anyone is interested, I'll fix these.

Even though it is E1M1, it has the BFG and Plasma Gun, so it will not work
with the shareware versions. If you are interested enough in the game to
want new levels, pay for Doom. I did, and I'm glad, because it is a great
game and it is well worth it.

Direct questions, comments, slander, etc. to lshelby@indy.net or
alt.games.doom.  I read the mail and a.g.d fairly regularly.

If there is one piece of advice I could give on playing this level, it
would be this: You'd be surprised at what you can find in the dark.

Have fun!
