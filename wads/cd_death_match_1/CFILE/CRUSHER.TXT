Title                   : CRUSHER.WAD   
                          The level is named after the device in the courtyard
                          Figure out how to work it.   If all else fails, read
                          the instructions. :) (On the ground)

Description             : This is my first level.   It is a combination of
                          all my great ideas I wanted to put into a level.
                          Since this is my first level, it has the mandatory
                          room with lots o' enemies.   There is a large maze
                          which can be solved using the "stay to the left"
                          method.   All secrets are hinted at so you won't
                          have to push every bit of wall to get 100% secrets.
                          Difficulty levels are implemented but it is easy on
                          skills 1-2 and I wouldn't recommend playing it.
                          Skill 4 is tough even for me, but it is the most 
                          fun to play.   Also, take a look at the overpass.
