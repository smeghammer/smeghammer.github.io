Hotelcal.wad Info
-----------------
I hope you enjoy this wad file.  It is my first real effort at constructing 
a level.  It may not be as good as some that you have seen, but I think it 
is half decent.  Have at it.  Enjoy the maiming and killing.

Revision completed on August 3, 1994.  
Several glitches have been fixed.  Also, keycards are required to open some
doors now.

If you are not using a front end launcher such as dfe.exe or dm.exe, it will
be necessary to enter idclev16 to reach the level.
