Description             :     You've teleported into the rear of yet another 
                          demonic stonghold. Intelligence reports there is a 
                          large hall within where many comrads have vanished. 
                          The final phrase of your orders bothered you. It 
                          said simply "Lots-a-luck!"                                                              
                              Yes... this is a large WAD but it saves fine. 
                          Just don't add any more "things" to it. (or 
                          sectors) Well... you can if you want but it won't 
                          save then.<g>
                               I really hope you enjoy it! (Comments welcome)

Episode and Level #     : E1M1 
Single Player           : Yes
Cooperative 2-4 Player  : Yes  (great fun... at least I liked it)

New Sounds              : No
New Graphics            : No
New Music               : Yes. The music is best if you have a wave table add 
                          on for your sound card. (Duh! Of course it is.<g>) 
                          Although it's quite decent without it. (I realize 
                          personal taste weighs heavy here.) You can revert 
                          to Doom's music by using Doom Music Editor 
                          (available in the Action Games Library in the 
                          Gamers Forum on Cserve as dmmusic.zip)
                          or by using DEU.(Available same place as DEU.zip)
                          
                          To change music by using DEU, throw the WAD into 
                          the editor and make any change (preferably delete 
                          a "thing" then add it back in. This way you won't 
                          have to rebuild the nodes.) Save and quit. This 
                          will put back the original music. Careful not to 
                          add anythig or the WAD won't save when you play.
