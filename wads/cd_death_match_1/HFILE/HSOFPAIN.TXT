Summary:
        I can't beat this one with 100% everythings and I designed it!
Even with all the goodies in the House there is barely enough firepower
to take the cyber-foozle. And there is no-one tough enough to pit
him against like in the real .WAD Best -I- can do is lure him away
and swipe the key to leave.
