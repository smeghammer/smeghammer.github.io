Description             : What's wet and clammy and smells like a cunt?

We've had a lot of great responses for both fishcake.wad and the award winning Cod2.wad
but we've decided to branch out and start with a slightly more difficult wad,  Is it OK?
It's good to hear that so many people are enjoying our efforts, we'll keep them up as 
long as we can think up other fish names!  There are coloUred keycards if you look 
hard enough.
