Description             : Opening scene on Phobos; your left standing guard 
                          at the hangar door. After what seemed like an 
                          eternity of listening to the screams of your buddies
                          over the radio, and the sounds of combat in the 
                          distance, your radio goes silent.

Editor(s) used          : Deu 5.2.1 and BSP 1.2
Known Bugs              : A couple of HOMs due to the complexity of the room

                          because you have to be standing in just the right
                          spot looking in just the right direction.
