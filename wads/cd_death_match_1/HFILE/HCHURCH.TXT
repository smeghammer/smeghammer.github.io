Additional Credits to   : -To Raven Software.  They've done something with
                           that id engine, alright.
                          -And to my girlfriend, Heidi, a fellow Heretic
                           player, who let me know that "this level better
                           be good - or you're in TROUBLE."  Yikes.  ;>

Story                   : OK, you want a story.  Well, let's see.  You get up
                          bright and early on Sunday morning to go to church.
                          But wait.  Something's wrong.  Someone has desecrated
                          the front of the church and left the altar boys
                          hanging!  You can only wonder if your pastor is
                          alright.  But since this is a Heretic WAD, of course
                          he isn't!  You better go underground to his little
                          wooden lodge to see what he left before "they" got
                          him, and fight your way out of what is now the Church
                          of the Heretic!   (ok, cheezy story.  sue me.)

Points of Interest      : Well, this is a kind of hybrid not-quite-single-
                          not-quite-deathmatch level.  It's not really that
                          great at either, and I think it's pretty easy to
                          figure out.  Just pay careful attention to the
                          teleporters.  They come in handy for the wussies
                          who try to run for the exit!

                          Watch out for an allusion to my favorite band of
                          all time.  Hint:  This is NOT halo 10.  I repeat.
                          NOT halo 10 in a digital format.  :)

                          And remember one thing: if you power up a FireMace
                          with a Tome of Power, the "big balls" CAN teleport.
                          ... <big-ass grin> ...

Cooperative 2-4 Player  : I guess

**** Construction ****
============================================================================

Base                    : New level from scratch.
Build Time              : About 10 plays of my Pearl Jam _Vitalogy_ CD
Editor(s) used          : HEU v5.21, BSP 1.2x

Known Bugs              : None, except for the sprite limit.  I'd imagine
                          that it'd get pretty hairy in a 4-player deathmatch.
                          Try to control yourself with that powered-up
                          Hellstaff.  Raven, we need a patch!!! I want 128
                          on-screen sprites!  At least!  :)

                          FireMace bug.  'Nuff said.

Unknown Bugs            : Email me.  Flame me.  Show me some tips.  I need
                          the correspondence. :)
