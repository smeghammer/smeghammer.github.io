Description             : Looks like a humble castle from the 
                          outside, but on the inside...

Additional Credits to   : Chris Walker for immense perseverance
                          in texture alignment, and Paul for

Known Bugs              : Slight texture alignment problem through one of the

                          noticed this late on and couldn't be bothered to 
                          fix this, as half the map would have needed to be
                          changed also
