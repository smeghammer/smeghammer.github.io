        This is my 2nd PWAD ever so if you dont like it dont play it.
        I would though appreciate your comments. Please e-mail me
        about what you think of it and what you like/dislike in it.
        I designed it so that it could be played as a deathmatch as well 
        as a regular level.
        LET THE MONSTER LOOSE!!!!!
