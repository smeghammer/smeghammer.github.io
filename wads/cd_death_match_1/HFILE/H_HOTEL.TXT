Description
-----------
        So far your vacation has been a pleasent one, until now...
You wake up from a good night's rest. The first thing you notice in
your pleasent hotel room is a shotgun next to the TV. You think to
yourself, why would there be a shotgun in your room? You grab it
anyway and go to the bathroom to take a shower. In the shower you
notice shells and armor. Again, you question why would there be
such things lying around. 
        After spending some time in the room you decide to leave
and get something to eat. As you open the door the hall is totally
different from the day before. A pool of blood is lying in the
doorway and you realize this is not the hotel you were in the day
before... this is the Hell Hotel.

Comments
--------
-Be sure to look at the rooms after killing all the baddies, I
 put a lot of time into detail (ie. the bodies on top of the
 picnic tables)
-My favorite room is the bar with the dance floor, disco lives :)
