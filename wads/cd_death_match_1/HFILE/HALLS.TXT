Misc. Author Info       : To try and satisfy my Doom addiction I figured I
                          would make a couple of new levels.  Often these
                          levels tend to be good for deathmatch.  Let me 
                          know what you think via e-mail.

Description             : You awake to find yourself in a strange building
			  it looks somewhat familiar, but you aren't sure.
			  It looks like some kind of processing plant.
			  Is this the end, or is it just the beginning?  You
			  could care less, so you open the door...

I would also like to thank Rapha‰l Quinet and all those who worked with
him, for making available DEU 5.21 (and previous versions).  Without this
great editor, this wadfile would not have been possible.
If you don't have the latest version of DEU, you can get it via anonymous
FTP from:
        bear.montefiore.ulg.ac.be
        \pub\doom\deu

I would like to thank ID Software for creating Doom, without it I would have
far too much free time on my hands.  Now if they can just figure out a way
for me to get college credit for playing!
