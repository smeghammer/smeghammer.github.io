Description             : The Halls of Hex = the Halls of Power
                          You've found the powerbase of all the Evil (tm)
                          coming through the portals. You gaze in shock
                          at scenes of carnage. No doubt about it, this
                          is where the more unfortunate of the marines
                          ended up. Up being the operative word...
                          This is what id couldn't bring themselves to
                          show. This is what _really_ happened to your
                          buddies....
                          Oh - and watch your back!
Known Bugs              : Well, not many, really ;). You may get some HOM in
                          the green room, near the pillars, but it should be
                          minimal. Some hexagonal walls appear and disappear,
                          this is a function of the DooM engine, I believe.
                          Likewise, some objects may momentarily disappear -
                          with over 1400 objects to take care of, that's not
                          surprising!
                          This level may not play well on slow machines,
                          but it _should_ play. It was developed on a
                          Pentium/60 w/ 48M RAM and S3 928 video. It's been
                          tested on a 486/66 (S3) and a 486/33 (S3 928). It
                          runs fine under DooM 1.5 (not tested on 1.6/1.7)

Feedback                  Please! What's good, what's bad (limit yourself
                          to 6 pages or so), what extras you'd like...
                          I'm more than happy to collaborate.
