Misc. Author Info       : Waiting for v1.4 and HOPING id fixes (changes) 
                          the 2 sided linedef maximum to prevent HOM's.
                          If this is the case, I will be re-releasing an
                          improved PURDUE.WAD that is better and faster
                          than the original.

Description             : Designed to be a deathmatch only level. There 
                          no monsters in here (add some if you want) so
                          single player might get dull real quick :-)
			  The level is kind of large, so a 2 player
			  deathmatch might take a while to get interesting.
                          There are five main areas connected by hallways
                          and passages, with barrels scattered throughout
                          (if your lucky you will get to use one :-)
                          Just run around and kill your friends !

Additional Credits to   : This level has its roots in the ledges series
                          but expands a bit.

Thanks to               : Dave Cusano, Steve Frey, Sam Geckler, Paul Hicks
