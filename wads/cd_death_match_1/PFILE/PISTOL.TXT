Description             : Try to survive with your basic pistol?
                          This is a VERY BASIC level.  This is my first        
                          attempt at using a Doom Editor. The purpose was to   
                          familiarize myself with the very basic features of   
                          the editor.  So, don't look for any elevators,       
                          lifts, or stairs.  However, after a liberal          
                          sprinkling of a few "friends", who can't or won't    
                          provide me with nothing more than bullets, the level 
                          was enjoyable while testing the basic features of    
                          the editor.  All weapons (except for the chainsaw)   
                          are here.  Sufficient ammunition for all is likewise 
                          present.  However, not too much in the way of        
                          medical assistance.  That's why the name "Run N'     
                          Gun" was chosen.  Because this is a complete         
                          learning process, I'll appreciate all comments.
