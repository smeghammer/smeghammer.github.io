Title                   : The Death Trap   
Filename                : PATMAN1.WAD
Author                  : Patrick C. Farabee
Email Address           : pfarabee@ezmail.ucs.indiana.edu
Misc. Author Info       : Just some guy who loves to Doom :)

Note:                   : This is my first REAL attempt at creating
                          a doom level, though that's no reason for you
                          to delete PATMAN1.* now.. give me a chance here :)

Description:            : This level is not for the heavy-fingered Doomer.
                          I'll tell you now that you shouldn't play it on
                          Ultra or Nightmare unless you are willing to die
                          alot trying to win.  I still have a little trouble
                          with it, and I WROTE the darn thing :)
                          It consists basically of a fairly complex sector
                          structure, with some well-hidden secrets and
                          ALOT of monsters :)  Probably not a very good
                          deathmatch, but haven't gotten to try that out yet
                          because our local system is not allowing Doom multi
                          for some reason.. :/   Anyway.. try it out and
                          tell me what you think.. comments allowed and very
                          much welcome.  Bear with me, I'm new at this :)

                          player and deathmatch, so there could be bugs.
