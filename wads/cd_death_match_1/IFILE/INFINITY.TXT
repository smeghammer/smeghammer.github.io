Misc. Author Info       : Special thanks go to Ed Boris for helping me
			  design and test the level for an optimum 
			  deathmatch. 

Description             : This is a "ledges" type wad.  It was designed 
			  entirely for Deathmatch but can be challenging 
			  for single player.  All the weapons are available 
			  plus BERSERK.  The basic layout is a figure eight 
			  or the "infinity" symbol (thus the name).   
			  Weapons and regeneration start points have been
			  strategically located and fine tuned after a lot 
			  of deathmatch play.  Health is limited as is ammo 
			  and armor.  Everything has been set up such that 
			  the players will have to visit the entire level 
			  for one thing or another.  Reference hint.doc 
			  for hints that may not seem obvious.

Org Description         : This level replaces E1M1.  Skill levels 1 and 2
			  have been designed for 2 player and skill level 
			  3 for 3 or 4 player.  Using Deathmatch 2.0
			  rules ensures a long battle.
