Description		: INYOFACE is a deathmatch only level without
			  any monsters except your friend-become-prey.
			  It's stricktly move fast and kick ass from
			  begining to end. The level consists of a
			  darkened arena in the center with an upper
			  level all around the rectangular perimeter.
			  The players start in one of four rooms at each
			  corner of the upper level. They will each find
			  a Health Supercharge, Blue Armor, Shotgun,
			  Chaingun, Plasma Rifle and Rocket Launcher. The
			  BFG 9000 is located in a pool in the middle of
			  the arena where lighting is bright enough to be
			  seen clearly. There are Teleporters in each of
			  the top and bottom corners so that you can travel
			  between the upper and lower level. This level is
			  great in DEATHMATCH 2.0 as well as regular
			  Deathmatch. Although there are no hidden rooms
			  there is plenty of opportunity for ambush.
			  This is the first level in a new Deathmatch only
			  episode Gil and I are developing, so keep an eye
			  out for future levels.

Note			: There are no lame traps in any of my Deathmatch
			  levels (I believe the purpose of Deathmatch is to
			  pit yourself against your opponent, not fall in
			  some stupid acid pit without a way out.
			  There's also a clearly marked exit in each of my
			  levels in preparation for the episode or if you
			  just want to continue playing on the next level.
