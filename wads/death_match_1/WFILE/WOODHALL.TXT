Misc. Author Info       : This is my first WAD uploaded. Comments via email
please, but if you wanna complain please explain your point: "this sucks" is
unhelpful. "This is great" is unhelpful, but sure feels good.

Description             : This is a butt-kicking WAD rather than a puzzle WAD
in playtesting it proved barely completeable on UV at first playing by someone 
unfamiliar with the layout, which seems about right. It's set in a large 
wooden building; I've tried not to use 2 million textures. It's low-tech: 
you're using the shotgun throughout, on sarges, imps, troopers and the odd
demon. It contains several unpleasant surprises. The use of excessive gamma 
correction is not recommended: it ruins the looks of the level, and should
prove unnecessary anyway, as the level is well-lit. It's most fun on first
playing, as the surprises ain't so aftrwards. There is no HOM AFAIK, and 
texture alignment seems to be fine, by and large. There is no attack in the
room you start in.
