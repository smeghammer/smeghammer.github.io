Description                    : This group of levels is made just by random 
                                 thought so it might not be a good designed 
                                 level. I just made whatever came to my 
                                 mind first.

                                 This group of levels is just for 1 player.
                                 Some secrets and some suprise attacks. No
                                 special new graphics or sounds.

                                 (I'd appreciate feedback on some opinions 
                                 about this.)
