Misc. Author Info       : This is my first WAD. However, with 
                          hours of lining up textures, and 
                          getting everything just right, I 
                          think this might be better than most.
                         
Description             : This is a Doom version of TSR's
                          Dungeons & Dragons module: White
                          Plum Mountain. There are some 
                          differences from the original module;
                          It was impossible to implement
                          some elements with the Doom engine,
                          but most of the features are included.

Note                    : For those who are unfamiliar with
                          using PWADs, just unzip this into
                          your Doom directory and type:

                          Doom -file white.wad
