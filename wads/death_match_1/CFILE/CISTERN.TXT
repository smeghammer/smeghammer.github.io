Description             : A series of stone corridors arranged around
                          a reservoir of blood somewhere in Hades. You
                          can SEE the exit (it's right in the middle) 
                          but how do you GET there? Plenty of tactical 
                          choices as to when and where to fight.

* Miscellaneous info *

Note the way the player is obliged to tackle sectors in the required
order although only one key is used. Despite this linear structure
the player has plenty of tactical choice, particularly with regard to
the trade-off between an early fire fight at long range or a later
one at closer range. The first option may be safer but more expensive 
in ammo. 

Watch you don't fall into any of the pits. Only one of them has any
way out. Falling into the cistern through ducking and weaving while
engaged in a firefight on an insecure ledge is a bad idea.

There are a couple of walls which look like they ought to be secret 
doors but aren't. Don't worry about it.
