Description             : This is a DEATHMATCH 2.0 pwad.
                          Please play this wad with -altdeath only.
                          You will lack the necessary ammo with origional 
                          deathmatch rules.  All weapons are accessable and 
                          a marked exit is included.
                          Monsters: CYBE! Just to keep you on the move.
                          For BEST results, Play a four player net, 
                          ultra-violence, with respawn switched ON! 
                          Complete with its own SkyLight Dome Ceilings!

Info                    : Being an advid Doom player since Dec. 10th '93,
			  I had to finally create 2nd PWAD in the
                          Spacelab Series.  This is my 2nd Deathmatch pwad.
                          The level is very OPEN, so you
                          won't search to long to get a frag.
                          
                                                                                       
Additional Credits to   : Brendon Wyber and Raphael Quinet for DEU.
