CIRCUS.WAD
================================================================

In the spirit of SHOWDWN2.WAD, I'd like to introduce CIRCUS for
the truly spirited DOOM player. As with Showdown II, Circus will
fill the screen with a mass of monsters, leaving you on the run
in this seemingly never ending three ring circus!

Enjoy,

Vance Andrew Blevins

P.S. It has been noted that for no apparent reason at all, _SOME_
     computers MAY get a "R_FindPlane: no more visplanes" error
     when running CIRCUS.WAD...
