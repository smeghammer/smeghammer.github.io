Misc. Author Info       : Created for the Oct '94 AVG DOOM DeathMatch
                          tournement.

Description             : Twisty passageways and sniper nests surroud A
                          large open pentagram shaped chamber.  The only
                          weapons you'll find are the shotgun, chaingun,
                          and Rocket Launcher (Great fun in the sniper
                          nests - Be careful though, some of the 'nests'
                          can suddenly become not-so-secret!).  Anyone
                          can get a frag with the Plasma gun, so weenies
                          keep out.  ;-)

Thanks to               : The guys at iD for such a Great (if extreamly
                          addicting) game and the authers of DEU and BSP
                          for their wonderful tools!
