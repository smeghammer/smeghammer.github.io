Description             : You've found the unknown altar to the CyberLord.
                          It looks just like a church... I wonder why?
                          The level is pretty easy, I just created it to
                          stir up trouble! Then I added some bad dudes...
Feedback                  Yeah, I know, you'll get the occasional HOM when
                          you're inside the church looking towards the door...
                          ...bad luck, it's a limitation of the engine :-)
                          Don't try to "fix" the untextured walls... it's
                          the only way I can get the DooM engine to give me
                          a "low" exterior and a "high" interior and still
                          get the SKY texture from within the building...
                          Please let me know if this level bugs out on any
                          particular revision of DooM... So far, it works
                          fine on 1.1/1.2/1.4/1.5.
