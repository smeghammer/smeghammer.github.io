                          a PC version of the old Mac classic arcade game 
                          Crystal Quest. Net junkie ;).

Short Description       : A fully furnished clipper ship, with rather 
                          hostile sailors. Extensive use of 'teleporter 
                          stairs' to simulate multiple levels.

Description             : The year: 1943
                          The place: Somewhere in the northern Atlantic.
                          The situation: Grim.

                          Alone in the middle of the Atlantic. You knew 
                          in your heart that it was the end when the 
                          escort, the HMS Marianna, picked up three U-
                          boats on the sonar. The Teela Dan didn't have a 
                          chance: the torpedoes split her wide open and 
                          she sank within seconds. You were lucky enough 
                          to launch one of the liferafts before she went 
                          down, but the others who dived overboard all 
                          died in agony when the fuel slick went up. 

                          You were hoping that the Marianna got an SOS 
                          away before she too went down, but no rescue 
                          ships have appeared and your water supply has
                          nearly run out. You are almost resigned to a 
                          lonely death on the high seas, when...

                          Wait! Is that.. Yes, it's a ship! An old one, 
                          by the looks of it, since it's running under 
                          sail. Luckily the breeze is very light, and 
                          you manage to paddle the raft into its course. 
                          However, nobody on board is responding to your 
                          hails. Strange... what's the name of the ship? 
                          You squint, and can just make out the name 
                          'Marie Celeste'. The Marie Celeste? Wasn't that 
                          the ship that was found mysteriously abandoned 
                          years and years ago? What the hell is it doing 
                          here? Well, there's only one way to find out! 

                          Grabbing the pistol from the emergency stores 
                          locker, you pull alongside and climb the rope 
                          ladder....

* Construction *

Base                    : New level from scratch
Editor(s) used          : DEU (5.21 GCC version), BSP11X, WAD_DWD/IDBSP,
                          RMB, Wacker, Deluxe Paint II, Graphics Workshop, 
                          PicLab (I've got too much HD space, 
                          obviously :).
Known Bugs              : An occasional tiny bit of HOM in v1.2 from the 
                          very rear of the ship. (sigh) :). Some of the 
                          inter-level connections are also a bit dodgy: 
                          in particular, none of the enemies will pursue 
                          a player up or down stairs (they are apparently 
                          too steep). 
Other                   : I *wish* that you could put floors and sprites 
                          properly in PWADS. I originally made this WAD 
                          about four months ago but never quite got 
                          around to releasing it. 

                          Although this WAD was primarily designed for 
                          single player play, it works well for two or 
                          three player deathmatch due to the multiple 
                          connectivity of most of the areas. If you want 
                          to get a really good weapon, though, you may 
                          find yourself trapped! Different weapons are 
                          available at different difficulty levels, and 
                          the plasma rifle and BFG are *not* included :).
