Description             : This level has been designed with a 
                          similar theme to E2M8. It's a huge
                          outdoor area with scores of large
                          pillars scattered randomly about;
                          there is a fairly large open area in the
                          center of the level... There are quite a
                          few lost souls flying around, but the
                          main adversaries (for single play) are
                          CyberDemons. Yes, that "s" belongs 
                          there! Here's what you will face with
                          the various skill levels:

            Skills 1 & 2: Tons of lost souls...
                          1 Imp (you'll see...)
                          1 CyberDemon

                 Skill 3: Tons of lost souls...
                          1 Imp (he does serve a purpose!)
                          3 CyberDemons
 
            Skills 1 & 2: Tons of lost souls...
                          1 Imp (something about this room...)
                          6 CyberDemons ;-D


                          Each skill level has enough ammo to
                          defeat all of the monsters (this *has*
                          been tested!). Thjs level should
                          seperate the men from the boys...
 
                          There's a smashing exit! This was in my
                          first PWAD (E2M1SAS.WAD) which (as far
                          as I know, was only distributed on AOL)
                          and fits in quite nicely.

                          The level has also been set up for Death
                          Match (a primary design feature!). Skill
                          3 is probably best for this. There are
                          hidden teleporters and a few other hidden
                          goodies for when the ammo is low and
                          your opponent is close...

                          BSP. I'd also like to thank all of the
                          people on ALT.DOOM.GAMES who were arguing
                          the best way to kill a single CyberDemon,
                          which is what gave me the idea for this
                          level. Have fun with 6, guys!

                          perhaps. No new images...

* Construction *

Base                    : New levels from scratch
Build Time              : 'Bout a day... (it's not that big...
                          Doesn't need to be!)

Known Bugs              : There's a hidden weapon that can sometimes

                          area that it is hidden in. It leaves you
                          wondering "Now where the hell did this come
                          from!?"...
