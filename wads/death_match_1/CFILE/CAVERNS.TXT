                          This is going to be the third level in a 

                          3 part episode  So let me know what u think.


Description             : Your on Mars ... the enemy's stronghold!

                          You just escaped from inside the prison level 

                          of the fortress. Unfortunately you landed right 

                          in the caverns underneath the enemy stronghold.

                          Your mission is to recover the new weapon from the 

                          enemy boss and somehow escape back to earth.  The 

                          weapon was stolen from a military research and

                          development facility back on earth right when 

                          it was perfected.  Retrieve it and escape.  

                          All u were told about the new weapon is that

                          it is one BIG F@#$%& GUN!

                          Good Luck!!
