This is just one of the rooms that I have been trying to build 
into my new level.  This is the only room that I am having 
problems with.  The main source of my problem is the center
piece in the large room.  When I have it in there I get some
major clipping effects.  I have tried to isolate the problem
by putting a wall around the center structure and this seems
to make the problem go away.  I need help determining if this
type of setup just cannot be done, as I want to get my level
up an running for all to share.  Please check this out and
let me know if you have any suggestions.  

Editor: DEU 5.0 (Non-Beta)
