Misc. Author Info       : This is my third wad, please check out
                          bop.wad and strmstr.wad, there really 
                          cool. Suggest, comments, critisicms, 
                          e-mail me. 

Description             : Dark, you'll feel foreboding DOOM after
                          starting this level. This level is pretty
                          linear, so you don't have to worry about 
                          getting the keys in the right order, because
                          you get the keys when you need them. Not easy.
                          Trust me, I created this level and it takes
                          me at least 15 minutes to get through, and
                          sometimes I get my ass kick.

Additional Credits to   :  Id and The Selmer company (for making 
                           great saxophones. Needed to relax after
                           playing this level, so I played my sax)
