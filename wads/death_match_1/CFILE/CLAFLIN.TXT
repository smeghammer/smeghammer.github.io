Description             : This level is a take-off of my Dorm
                          (Claflin Hall) at Boston University.
                          There have been many elements added to
                          make it interesting.  This is my first
                          Wad, yet it doesn't suck!

Additional Credits to   : my dedicated band of playtesters 8^)
