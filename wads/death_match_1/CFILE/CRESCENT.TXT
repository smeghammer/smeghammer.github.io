Description             : The idea for the layout is borrowed from 
                          STARWAR1.WAD by Matt Falk. In no way is this
                          wad connected to any of the tremendous wads 
                          in the starwars series by Matt Falk. If his
                          next ones are as good as STARWAR1, then I will
                          have to buy some more floppy disks to store
                          them. 
                        : The name of the wad is obtained from the 
                          shape of the map.
                        : The story:
                          As humanity reaches out into the unexplored
                          regions of space they may encounter some less-
                          than-friendly races. One such incidence occurred
                          a few years ago on Pluto. The base, a sector 
                          of the Specialized Planetary Defence (SPD) ring
                          was overrun by some nasty semi-humanoids with a
                          bad attitude. An unsuspecting marine on an
                          inspection tour landed and was suprised to find
                          the base crawling with "things" he had never
                          seen before. He had had bad receptions before,
                          but not like this one...

Known Bugs              : One wall will cause an error in the program if
                          you push on it. It happened after I tried to
                          delete a sector, the adjoining wall became
                          sensitive. I presume this is a bug in the
                          editors since the surviving sector looks 
                          normal as does the linedef. One door will not
                          open from one side, despite every attempt to
                          get it to. One small protruding wall is clear
                          even though both editors report it solid.
