Description             : Primarily a DEATHMATCH - you fight off
around a chasm filled with lava. There are thin bridges to cross
in various places, allowing you and you adversary access to the
awesome arsenal of automated armaments that DOOM has to offer!
(Whew! What alliteration!)
All the weapons are available, and one CAN commit suicide...


Additional Credits to   : Nobody!!! Er.. except, that is, to all
those wonderful people at Id, and the makers of DEU, and BSP, and 
rest.

* Construction *

Base                    : New level from scratch
Editor(s) used          : DEU 5.2, BSP 1.1x, and Win HexEdit to change the
                                level number, since I started as E1M1.
Known Bugs              : Some Hall of Skies down in the lava pit due to the
                                tall height (though less than 1023), but then
                                again, who would want to go down there? :)
