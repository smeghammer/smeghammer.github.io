Description             : A level pretty much suited for Deathmatch play
                          only. A single winding sector with four player
                          and four deathmatch starts, various pesky little
                          monsters, and various weapons ranging in strength
                          from chainsaw to plasma gun. (Beware launching
                          missiles at a dead run in a twisty canyon or it
                          really will be a dead run <g>).

* Construction *
============================================================================

Base                    : New level from scratch

Note                    : This level DOES have exits, even though they
                          aren't readily apparent. At each end of the
                          canyon there are three walls which will exit
                          the level when you hit the "Open" key. I did
                          not put switches in because a huge wall of
                          switches in an otherwise pristine canyon wall
                          did not appeal to me.
