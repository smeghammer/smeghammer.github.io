CHALLENG.WAD

Thanks for downloading this homemade WAD file.....

To use this file, copy CHALLENG.WAD into your Doom (registered version) 
directory and type the following command line:

DOOM -FILE CHALLENG.WAD

Then warp to Episode 2, Level 2. 
(Do this by typing IDCLEV22 while in the game.)

This is a pretty challenging WAD that I attempted to make tough for
people who like to abuse the cheat codes. It has no doors that need keys so you are
stuck with finding the correct switches to open doors.
It is also great for playing multi-player and Deathmatch modes.
I know that there are some Linedef problems which creates a "hall of mirror"
effect at certain points, but I did the best I could at fixing them.
Please e-mail with any comments or advice concerning this WAD.

Enjoy!!!!

P.S. Look up my first WAD, DMSEWER.WAD if you get a chance....
