WAD Authoring Template V1.4   (Clip this line)
================================================================
Title                   : Gum wad.
Filename                : gum.wad
Author                  : Justin "J.T." Ward.
Email Address           : ward@escape.com
Misc. Author Info       : J.T. is just there for show. Finger me for more info.
Description             : It's a pretty simple thing, really. It just puts you
                          in a huge room with like a billion enemies and
weapons to your heart's content. The thing with the walls going up is really
nothing-- it just makes it look a little different from all the rest. And
regarding the music, I spent a lot of time searching my hard disk for the most
inapropriate background music for Doom. While I'm sure there's worse(better?),
I think I made a good desicion.

Additional Credits to   : The good people of #doom for talking about gum while
                          I was trying to think up a name for this thing. :)
