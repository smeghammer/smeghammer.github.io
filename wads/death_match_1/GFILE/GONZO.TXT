Other: *** GUIDE TO LIFTS & SUCH ***

1) In the Blue and Red rooms there are lifts up to the side halls
   at each end of the room. You can get up in the slits looking out to 
   the center by standing at the slit facing out and hitting the spacebar.  
   The glowing red and blue squares teleport you to the center.  
   (The door out to the center also works).

2) In the center:  See the large black hole in each of the long dark gray walls?
   The floor is a lift from the center into the hole.

3) If you fall in the radioactive muck, your three options are as follows:
   1) Run under one of the floating teleport pillars.
   2) Run to the center...each side of the center is a lift.
   3) The red and blue walkways leading out from the red and blue doors
      are lifts.

Have fun & let me know how you like it...
