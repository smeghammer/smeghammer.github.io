DESCRIPTION: 	This is a built from scratch level.  It was created using
		DoomCAD 4.3 by Matt Tagliaferri.  This is my first serious
		attempt. I appreciate any comments or feedback (good or bad)
		that you may have.  It's not a huge file so it should run 
		well on most all machines.  There may be a few bugs here and
		there, but I think you will find it interesting.

Storyline:	You have been mysteriously transported to the coliseum of 
		the demi-gods.  You have been chosen to fight for the viewing 
		pleasure of Satan and his minions.  You are now a gladiator 
		in this merciless bloodsport and the only way out is over 
		the dead bodies of the other competitors.  If you survive
		the competition, you must then ascend the heights of the
		coliseum and fight your way to the point of no return and
		make a leap of faith into the pit.....

		
Credits:	Id software (of course), Matt Tagliaferri and the other 
		creators of DoomCAD,  and my wife, Amy who has put up
		with me.
