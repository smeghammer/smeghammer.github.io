Description             : You managed to fight your way through the
                          main level of the base, making your escape
                          down the primary air return shaft.  Now
                          you're crawling through the base's air plant,
                          hoping to make it through the air ducts and
                          the condenser, and get out into the storage
                          sublevels.  If you can get to the reactor
                          room, you should be able to set the reactor
                          to blow, which will sterilize the whole base
                          for you and neutralize the threat.  You
                          THINK you should be able to escape through
                          the emergency cooling wastewater duct.....


                          Another fairly large level, though a lot
                          smaller than GRENDEL1.WAD.  All indoors this
                          time.  Conserve your ammunition, you'll need
                          it to get through.

Known Bugs              : HOM in the large storage area, in DOOM! engine
                          versions prior to 1.6.  This area was DESIGNED
                          for 1.6; there's just too many visible sidedef
                          segments in there for earlier versions to handle.
                          If you don't have 1.6 or later yet, live with it;
                          the HOM's not THAT bad.
