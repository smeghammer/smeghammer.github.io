Welcome to Gore1.wad!!!  (10 hours of hard work)			20/4-1994

This is a strictly deathmatch field. It makes you extremely paranoid, there´s almost nowhere
to cover your back. You start every time with two weapons: a rocket launcher and a chaingun. 
A hint: there are two suicide pits, once you enter them you can´t get up. They are 
both useful and dangerous ;-) : when you are low on ammo, you can commit suicide (there is 
no extra ammo on the field), but the other players can quite easily get to you. Works 
best with three or four players, though it´s small, two players may run for a long time
without meeting. 

So happy dooming (as they say...)
