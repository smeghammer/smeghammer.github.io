Description [the story so far...]:

   You were just beamed down from the mother ship to investigate the
architectural remains of an ancient alien culture.  The scanners picked
up no life signs, so a minimal away team was assembled. 
   Just as you reach the surface, a message comes over your comm pad... 
"Red Alert! Intruder on board!"
   Loud growls and hissing are heard through the speaker followed by
sporadic plasma blasts and the blood curdling screams of your fellow
crew mates.  Seconds later connection is lost.  No time to spare, you
must figure out where you are and how to get back to your ship... 
   The lmp shows all the secret doors.  There is (in my opinion) a very
cool scene where I fight off four Cacodemons with a shotgun in the
middle of a big courtyard.  Enjoy!
