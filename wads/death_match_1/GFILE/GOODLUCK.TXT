                          Big MoDoomer with a lust for levels.

Description             : This level is another in the "lucky" series.
                        To play this level w/ any chance of completing
                        it, you must use Super DooM Guns!  For any of
                        you with a heart problem or low Dooming ability
                        erase this wad now, it's not worth your time!
                        All others continue reading.

                        This level is, as are all in the series, a test 
                        for those who think they are adept at Dooming.
                        This level is not impossible, just looks that way
                        at first.  Quite a few monsters inhabit the level
                        with increased #s in UV setting.  PLEASE DON'T USE
                        THE CHEAT CODES! They won't show you if you are as 
                        good as you think you are.  
                        Well, GOODLUCK!
