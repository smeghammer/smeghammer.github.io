Description             : Try this small WAD as the eigth level 
                          on the first episode.  It's not large,
                          but fun if you try it starting with a
                          pistol only!  NOTE: you must warp to 
                          level 8 on episode 1 for this WAD to
                          work, it will not work if you change 
                          the WAD to any other level.

* Hints for this WAD *

    I got the idea for this one from a King Kull comic.  Starting with a
  pistol, try running circles around the enemy, then get intimate with
  the chainsaw.

  To run this wad, copy it to your DOOM directory, go to your DOOM 
  directory, and type the following:

    doom -devparm -file gladiatr.wad -warp 1 8 -skill x

    where x is the skill level you wish to use.

  Leave a message if you like the level, feedback is always good for
  deciding what I will put in my next WAD.
