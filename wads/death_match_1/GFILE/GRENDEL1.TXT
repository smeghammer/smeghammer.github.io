Title                   : Terravia Part 1: Assault Drop
Filename                : GRENDEL1.WAD

Misc. Author Info       : Beginning DOOM! hacker, NRA activist,
                          unrepentant Goonophile, and maintainer
			  of the official ICB client FTP site.

Description             : This is a fairly large level, most of
                          which is "indoors".  It's mostly fairly
                          conventional, but there are a few fun
                          little twists.  One planned "scenery"
                          feature didn't make it in because of the
                          DOOM! engine's >64-2S-HOM bug, but may
                          be added after 1.5 comes out if the
                          engine bug is fixed as promised.
                          See the enclosed file, BRIEFING.TXT, for
                          more details.
                          NOTE:
                          This WAD comes with a set of modified weapon
                          sprites.  The new sprites are simply rotated
                          (and sometimes flipped) versions of the
                          existing sprites for the chaingun, shotgun,
                          rocket launcher and plasma rifle.  If you wish
                          to use these sprites, you must unzip this
                          archive using 'pkunzip -d'.  Batch files are
                          provided to install and remove the modified
                          sprites.
                          Installing the new sprites looks a little odd
                          when you kill sergeants, but was done in order
                          to make the armory look way cool.  (And it
                          DOES make it easier to find shotguns in the
                          compound, too....)
			  After DOOM! 1.5 becomes available, the sprites
			  will be inserted directly into the WAD,
			  eliminating the need for installation with
			  DMGRAPH.

                          This is version 3.1 of this WAD.
