Title                   : LA GALERIA DELUXE
Filename                : GALERIA.WAD
Author                  : Mad_Alex and his Doom-Enemy J”rg
Offical release date    : 07-06-1994
Email Address           : yeah, c u soon on InterNet
Misc. Author Info       : There is nothing Misc. to say

Description             : This Level represents the ultimative 
			  two player Deathmatch arena. There are
			  some (we call it "galeria") windows
			  to shoot out and some fine dark rooms and
			  of course a chainsaw-arena (with nasty doors).
			  This level's seize is good for reaching
			  your opponent fast and intercept it.
			  Nothing for wimps who try to escape or
			  hide (you guys will be hunted easily).
			  We haven't tried it, but we think that
			  this level is too small for a good 4
			  player Match. This version is much 
			  harder in the ultra violence mode !
			  2 spiders and a Cyber Demon ! The people
			  wanted a harder version of LA GALERIA
			  for single player, so here it is :-))

			  THIS IS THE NEWER DELUXE VERSION OF LA GALERIA !
			  ATTENTION: THERE WAS A FILE GOING AROUND !
				     A LAMER GROUP CALLED
				     "THE INCREDIBLE PUPIL COOPERTION"
				     RE-RELEASED OUR LEVEL WITHOUT
				     ANY CREDITZ TO US ! KILL THESE
				     FUCKIN' LAMERS EVERYWHERE YOU SEE
				     THEM !

Additional Credits to   : Well, those who were good to us by
			  creating some Editors or something.

			       that is what we recommend / but
			       3 and 4 player starts are also there)

Difficulty Settings     : Well, who of you wanna-be doom gods play
			  in some kid-difficulty like "please don't hurt me"?
			  So, there is no difference (hahahaha)
			  NO - ONLY IN THE OLDER VERSION
			  In the Deluxe version you must choose ultra
			  violence to get new harder doom enemies !

New Sounds              : Yes, 23 new cool samples in the galeria.wad !

New Music               : Yes, taken from Episode 2 Level 7 !

Start Option            : Start wad file with "Doom -file galeria.wad" !
			  Then choose Episode 1, ultra violence :-)

Demos Replaced          : 1 (the first demo is to show you where the weapons
			     lie and so on, but don't look at it, if you want
			     to discover these things yourself!)
			     Sorry, but you can't see the end, because the
			     doom recorder has a time limit of 15 minutes.
			     This is why the demo suddenly ends ... !
