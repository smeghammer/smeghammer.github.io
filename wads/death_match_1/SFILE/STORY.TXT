                               The Ultimate Czech Level for DOOM by Pavel Hodek
_______________________________________________________________________________

The level is based on a comics sci-fi story. Here it is - just briefly:

You are one of two astronauts who survived the swarm of the asteroids. Now,
the huge spaceship on its voyage to explore the unknown civilizations seems
to be dead. Nobody from the crew will ever breath its fresh air as it flew out
to the space. The two friends decide to repair the ship and try to get back
to the Mother Earth. They don't know their spaceship GALAXIA is approaching
a black hole.
...
Nothing could save them. GALAXIA flew through the black hole and got to very
strange planetary system. One of the plantes resembled the Earth. Having no
idea where they are, the two astronauts decided to examine it closer. They
discovered a strange orbital lab and decided to visit it. They took a probe
module with some weapons, left GALAXIA and managed to get into the space lab.
It was abandoned. Their computer cryptographer revealed some information about
the planet. Only higher radioactivity made it different from the Earth. The
mystery of the planet was so strong that they didn't hesitate a minute and 
their probe module sank through the atmosphere. They penetrated over
the ocean. With their high speed they soon got to an island which seemed to be
covered with deep forest. Approaching the island, they were attacked by a huge
red insect. Their probe was damaged but they managed to escape. The probe
could not be controlled safely and there was a possibility of explosion. They
have good luck and soon flew over the continent. The town with high buildings
on the coast was faintly familiar, but undoubtable abandoned as well. Every-
thing was very strange. The probe started to lose height and forced the two
astronauts land near the city. There were several bad-looking trees and a lake
with clear water. They didn't catch to leave the probe and were attacked by two
huge "flies". It was no problem for built-in guns. But it didn't say anything
hopefull about the planet. The only sign of life they encountered so far was
giant insect. One "fly" tried to pick some white thing from grass. They decided
to have a look. What they saw, was a human body being captured in a web. They
began to tear the cocoon and found out, they had just saved a young girl.
She communicated with them by means of telepaty and narrated them about her
nation being held in underground storage areas by the huge insect. As she
talked several minutes they learned the terrible history. The scientists had
developed a special weapon of massdestruction based on biology. But the
experiments had got out of their hands. One of the experiment explosions had 
been so strong that people had had to hide in the underground if they hadn't
want to be seized by deadly bacteria. Soon everything on the surface had died.
There had been just a few kinds of insect that had mutated, grew to an 
unbelievable size and survived. The spiders had got very inteligent and
attacked the Mankind. The most inteligent spiders had formed a comunity and
enslaved the less inteligent kinds of spiders. Now, they use them to fight 
against people who are absolutly defensless.
The nubmer of people is lower day to day. They form small groups and live in
underground storage areas among crates containg stuff necessary to survive.
Sometimes a few man decide to go up to the surface to bring some weapons but
nobody ever returns.
...
Now, you are the one, who has a weapon. But the probe is useless. The plan is
clear. Your friend stays and will try to fix it. You will go with that girl to
the underground.
...
You meet the people from the underground and see that they believe in your
help. You are their God who can help them. They know they have another home
in the space. (Now you recall that space lab.) They offer you their best
weapon - shotgun. One man managed to get back. He talked about mutated friends,
who tried to get on the surface earlier, browsing around the corridors without
aim, some of them having shotgun, some of them having just a pistol. He killed
one of them and brought the gun. They must have been captured by spiders and
poisened somehow.
The conversation is interrupted by the sound of steel. One of the spiders
- slaves is penetrating the area. They already know about you. Everybody is
shouting. In several seconds, you can't see anybody. You are staying in a
storage area, shotgun on the ground before your eyes. The steps of the spider
cause the ground to shake under your feet. You have no choice. You must face
it. You just hope that the way to the probe will be as easy as the way to the
underground. You remember the way through the drainage, subway and narrow cave
corridors. You must make it alive, get to your friend and take off with
repaired probe module.


Hint: Your friend could switch the shields of the probe on to prevent anybody
to enter it. So be carefull, if you have too much blood on your face, the
protection system can beam you upto 500 meters far from the module. :)

O.K., you made it alive to the probe module. You hope you open the door and
meet your friend. I will not pretend that their civilization has not
invented anything like teleporter. A small example was in the underground.
Isn't it strange that your friend didn't help you out there? Nothing could
be easier then pressing fire on probe's laser guns. And instead of your friend,
a baron awaits you in the entrance. Or was it your a little mutated friend?
Just open the door to the level e1m9 (it is in the same pwad file, type:

		doom -devparm -file galaxia.wad -wart 1 9 -skill 4

		   Now you will see what is the reality.

O.K. You took off and got to GALAXIA. Now, you can take some more powerfull
weapons for those poor people on the planet and help them get into the lab
from where they could lead a war against spiders. You don't have any other
plans as you will probably never see the Earth again.

Many thanks for playing my level(s). I hope you enjoyed it.
Now, it is time to type several words and mail them to me:
Don't forget recordings!!!!!!! I need them! (Both, e1m1&e1m9)
