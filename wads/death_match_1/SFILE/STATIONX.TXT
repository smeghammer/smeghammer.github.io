Description             : The genetic experiments at the Universal
                          Acme Corp. have gotten out of hand. You
                          must clean up the mess, find the computer
                          control central, shut it down and destroy
                          it. This wad shows off many of the neat
                          things DOOM can do. Plenty of ammo and 
                          weapons if you use the right strategy. 
                          Watch out for traps! You WILL be killed
                          the first time through!
