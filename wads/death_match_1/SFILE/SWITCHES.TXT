Description             : Just shoot every monster and try to find the
                          right switch to bring down the red key in the
                          yard. Elsewhere, look for secret rooms/passages.
                          ...there are few of them.

Other: Well, that's it...I hope you'll enjoy playing this wad as much as I 
did when making it! This is my first wad ever made, so there was a lot of
