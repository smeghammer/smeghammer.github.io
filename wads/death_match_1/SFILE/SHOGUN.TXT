Description             : A difficult level but definitely not impossible.
                          There are no traps but there are plenty of ambush 
                          areas. I designed one room to be similar to the
                          room with the star in E1M9. The only Level Boss
                          included are a few Barrons. All weapons except BFG
                          and chainsaw are included. Don't rush into a room
                          unless you want to die. Use strategy! I would have 
                          called this Ambush level but the name was already   
                          used. I am interested in what you think so don't
                          hesitate to E-Mail me your comments or questions.
