This WAD was created using DEU, IDbsp and RMB.
RMB is a program of mine (a Reject Map Builder)
and with this wad comes the SNEAK.REJ file,
that demonstrates the use of a REJect option
file.

The SNEAK.RPT file is an output file from RMB,
that shows where there are possible line of
sights that crosses more than 16 two-sided lines.
(Only the two endpoint sectors are written).
I have played this WAD at all difficulty levels,
and It's not very hard to complete
(once you know how)
