Description             : You've agreed upon a site - the "old"
			  remains of a castle.  Only in this 
			  fortress shows signs of alien
			  occupation-metalic walls, and a 
			  radioactive moat juxtaposed with 
			  ancient carved lion heads.  You scramble 
			  to the front entrance, knowing that
			  inside lies the weapondry you need to
			  quash your opponents.  Only the castle 
			  stands between you and victory.
			  The siege is just beginning...
