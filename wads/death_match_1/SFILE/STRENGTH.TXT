Description             : Welcome to Training Level 1. You have just arrived
                          at the new training base and have been assigned a
                          light test to see how you fare in battle. If you
                          pass you will continue being tested until you are
                          ready for full combat. This test will NOT be easy,
                          but with a little strength, you should survive.

* Additional Info *

This is my first level, so any comments would be appreciated. Was meant to go
along with a general Star Wars theme, but like my friends (Josh Schultz) got
sidetracked along the way. This was meant to complement his level, but can
stand alone (and maybe should). I tried a few ideas out here, copied a few,
but in general the ideas are mine. As for traps, DON'T fall in pits since you
don't get out, but that should be it. Everything else has a way out (unlike my
first revision). Enjoy!
