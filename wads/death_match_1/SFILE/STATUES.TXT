Description             : This is my first go at a doom level.
			  It tends to reflect my liking for large rooms
			  which don't look too dangerous initially.

			  I think it is a reasonable test for the average 
			  player, although I suspect the real experts
			  won't have too much difficulty.

			  There's nothing silly like Cyberdemons and all 
			  the problems have solutions, I promise.  There's
			  plenty of ammo and weapons about, especially if 
			  you find all the secret rooms.

			  It runs at acceptable speed on my lowly 20 MHz 486sx.
			  	
			  It's very much designed for single play, so I've not
			  set it up for multiple players.
