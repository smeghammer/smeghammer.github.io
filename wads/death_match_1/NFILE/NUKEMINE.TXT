Misc. Author Info       : My girlfriend thinks I'm a DOOM-geek (sh-ya, right!)

Description             : It appears that there has been an incident
			on Nexus 14.  Nexus 14 is a mining planet, which
			basically means its a rock floating in some shitty
			solar system.  Nexus 14 is known across the universe
			for its rich content of Nuke, a green substance that
			makes a great meat spread, paint thinner or extra
			firm hair gel.  Anyways, the last report from the 
			Nexus 14 communications centre warned of an attack
			from creatures released through a time-continuem
			breach (sorry if that's spelled wrong).
				You have been ordered to go in as survelance
			only.  You are to assess the situation and be out in
			two hours to report to your commanding officer so that
			preparations can be made for a counter assault.
				The only problem is, you think your tough 
			enough to take on the army of creatures yourself.  You
			stupid twit!  What makes you think that one person
			could possibly drive off an entire army of blood sucking
			demons from Dimension-X?  Fine then, go ahead...

Additional Credits to    Sounds:  I admit it... I'm a thief.  I STOLD some
			sounds from the aliens sound package and also from the
			Laura Beyer add on packages (sorry).
			 Deu52:  I can't wait for Deu version 6!!! No wait. On
			second thought, my deu.log is over 300K...
				HOLY SH*T I'M AN ADDICT!
			 BSP 12x: Couldn't live without it (although I'd like
			to get my hands on the nodes builder that id uses,
			it might solve my problems (see bugs section))

* Construction *

Base                    : New levels from scratch
Editor(s) used          : deu, bsp, dmmusic, dmgraph, dmaud, wt100
			  graphic workshop and even paintbrush for Windows too!
Known Bugs              : I had some real node building problems in missions
			  7 and 8.  Try as I could, there are some HOM effects
			  (god, I feel like an amateur).
			  A couple of the levels are not very friendly for
			  multi-play.  I didn't beta test using two players
			  until it was too late.  Big hints for me
			  1.  Even though a door may need a colored key, always
				make the backside a normal door. That way if
				only one player has a key in a new area and they
				die, the other player is not trapped in there.
				Sorry about that.
			  2.  Always have enough radiation suits for everyone.
				It really sucks to have to stand there and
				watch as someone else does all the work.
				Sorry about that.

HEY YOU READ ALL OF THIS!!

Well just for you, here's a helping hint.  The new graphics I made were
kind of a last minute thing so they only appear in Missions 6,7,8 & 9.
If you only want to see the new graphics warp these missions.  Or else you
can use the batch file nukegraph to view the textures (you'll of course need
to have dmgraph.exe handy).

Also, if anyone would like to know how I made the new textures here's how...
Using wad tools, I made lbm graphic exports of ceiling textures that I thought
were cool as well as one texture that had dimensions of 128x128 bits.  Using
graphic workshop in windows I converted the lbm files to bmp formats.  I opened
up about 5 paintbrush programs in windows and then opened up all of the bmp
files at once.  Using the 128x128 bmp as a template, I copied and pasted bits
of the ceiling and floor textures onto the 128x128 wall.  I found I had to do
this because if I copied a 256 color image into a new paintbrush file, it
would not store it as 256 colors, rather as a 16 color load of garbage.  The 
other reason is that the 128x128 bmp serves as a nice template so you know
how big everything is.  Also note that a ceiling or floor texture is 64x64 bits,
so if you copy four sections onto your 128x128 wall you have a new texture that
will line up with itself on both sides.  For best results in paintbrush, use
the keyboard arrows to fine tune your position.  Play around with it, you'll
soon find what works best for you.  
For the grated windows, I used one ofthe ceiling textures with grating, zoomed
in, filled the holes with cyan and copied it onto my new wall.
Whamo! Instant walls with little see through bits.
I then used gws to convert the bmp back to gif files.  I used wad tools to find
some wall textures that were 128x128 and are really bad walls to look at (sorry
id, but there are a couple).  128x128 walls are something like 17,544 in 
size, for example all those concrete walls).  Then using dmgraph.exe, I stored
these gif files in a pwad file.
If you are curious to know, the whole procedure took about 4 hours for the
20 textures that I made.

If you read all of this then you are a very curious minded person and you
may want to get in touch with me by e-mail.  There is soooo much to tell you.
