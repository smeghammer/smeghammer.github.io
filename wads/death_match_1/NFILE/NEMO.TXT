Description            : My first attempt at creating a level.  Basically
                         an exercise in trying new things, but there
                         are some interesting areas.  This is the first
                         of a continuing series, and in it, the player
                         gains access for the first time to the 
                         subterranean boatyard.  Try to get through
                         the whole thing without cheats -- I designed
                         it to be possible with a little common
                         sense, practice and caution.

Comments                : Since this is the first level I've created and 
                          released to the public, I ask that you shoot me 
                          an E-mail or reach me via CServe or MGBBS
                          and let me know what you think!  What was cool,
                          what sucked, was it too hard, too easy, etc.  
                          Through feedback I hope to improve my meager 
                          skills.
