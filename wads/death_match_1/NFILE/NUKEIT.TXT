Description : This is a keeper.  NUKEIT was made
              using DEU Editor. I really enjoyed
              learning this fine tool.  I'm looking
              forward for future releases. A lot of 
              time was spent aligning textures and
              adding lighting effects.

Special thanks to: id software, and Brendon Wyber 
                   and Rapha Quinet.
