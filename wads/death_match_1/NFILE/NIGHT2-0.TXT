Description             : **** Optimised for DEATHMATCH 2.0 ****
                          This wad has been designed for three to four player
                          deathmatch. It has been extensively play
                          tested, and has proven to remain interesting
                          over long periods of play.

                              The first time I played it I clocked the 
                              frag counter. Highly recommended...."

                              relationship would have ended. In this wad
                              Andrew shows true talent as a DooM editor. 
                              But then again, I could just be biased."
