Description             : Constant action DEATHMATCH 2.0 levels.

These are the first 3 in a series of Doom Deathmatch levels. Each of
the levels has a different theme, and I tried to build them with individual
consistancy in mind.  All of them are designed for high action.

Zorf 1 - The Clover
    - Very open clover shaped area designed for lots of running and 
      chasing, and lots of offense.  The intention was to eliminate
      ambush and safe spots, and keep the game moving at a fast pace.
    - All the goodies are very easy to get but not without risk.  You'll
      want to take the elevators to the upper tunnels, but be careful,
      your location will obvious.
    - Look up to find the exit.

Zorf 2 - The Maze
    - This level is really 2 in one.  In the normal state, it's mazelike
      and your enemy may be just around the corner.  Hit the switches
      in the ooze, and some of the walls drop to dramatically change the
      layout.  If more than one of you is in the center room, usually only
      one gets out alive!
    - This is the only DM level I have seen where you can alter the layout
      while playing.  Just find one of 4 switches in the ooze and see how
      things change.
    - The exit is not on the map and can only be found with the walls dropped.

Zorf 3 - The Bridge
    - There are two main battle areas separated by a narrow bridge.
      You better be able to jump or you won't get any of the goodies...but
      be careful, the walls seem to be alive!
    - You won't find any lifts, doors or obstructions of any type. You
      won't find many corners you can hide scared in either.
    - Lean on the walls in the deepest part of the basement to find the secret
      area and the way to the exit.  A huge reward awaits the first one to find
      the super secret area and the secret exit. (think big jump) Neither exit
      is on the map.
