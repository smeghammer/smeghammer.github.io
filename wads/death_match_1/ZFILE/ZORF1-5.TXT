Description             : Constant action DEATHMATCH 2.0 levels.

These are the first 6 in a series of Doom Deathmatch levels. Each of
the levels has a different theme, and I tried to build them with individual
consistancy in mind.  All of them are designed for high action.

Zorf 1 - The Clover
    - Very open clover shaped area designed for lots of running and 
      chasing, and lots of offense.  The intention was to eliminate
      ambush and safe spots, and keep the game moving at a fast pace.
    - All the goodies are very easy to get but not without risk.  You'll
      want to take the elevators to the upper tunnels, but be careful,
      your location will obvious.
    - Look up to find the exit.

Zorf 2 - The Maze
    - This level is really 2 in one.  In the normal state, it's mazelike
      and your enemy may be just around the corner.  Hit the switches
      in the ooze, and some of the walls drop to dramatically change the
      layout.  If more than one of you is in the center room, usually only
      one gets out alive!
    - This is the only DM level I have seen where you can alter the layout
      while playing.  Just find one of 4 switches in the ooze and see how
      things change.
    - The exit is not on the map and can only be found with the walls dropped.

Zorf 3 - The Bridge
    - There are two main battle areas separated by a narrow bridge.
      You better be able to jump or you won't get any of the goodies...but
      be careful, the walls seem to be alive!
    - You won't find any lifts, doors or obstructions of any type. You
      won't find many corners you can hide scared in either.
    - Lean on the walls in the deepest part of the basement to find the secret
      area and the way to the exit.  A huge reward awaits the first one to find
      the super secret area and the secret exit. (think big jump) Neither exit
      is on the map.

Zorf 9 - Rising Posts
    - Nothing tricky here!  Whoever is the best shot will live, the others
      will die.  It takes patience and a little luck to pick up items.
    - Wimps don't play this because there is absolutely no where to hide.
    - The exit is not on the map but if you grab the rad suit, you can decend
      there with no problem.
 
Zorf 4 - The Sewer
    - Here you will often be fighting your enemy across a sewer of ooze.
      You can travel around through narrow tunnels, or jump in the ooze for
      quick access to anywhere on the level.
    - Seeing your weakened opponent frantically run away in a pool of ooze is
      almost worth a frag itself.
    - Weapons are obvious, but getting them is risky.  Letting your
      opponent get the weapons is even riskier...for you!  
    - The exit is in a very dark ambush area, but you may not find it if the
      secret door hasn't been opened.  Oh, and it's not on the map.

Zorf 5 - Slaughter Circle
    - This is an open level with a lot of access to weapons and health.  There
      is lots of running and chasing, and there will be many frags.
    - Around the perimeter, there are 6 mini-fortresses.  Each of these has
      some kind of goodie, and offer a place to duck behind.  Be careful
      because you may get trapped by your oppenent with little chance of
      survival.
    - If you need extra health, try taking the center stairway up towards the
      sky.  If you fall between the stairs, you may get a surprise bonus.
    - To get to the exit, go up as high as you can, then jump...the exit may
      then appear.
