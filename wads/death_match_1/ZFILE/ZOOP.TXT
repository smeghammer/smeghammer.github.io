Email Address           : Hold tight, ones coming.
Misc. Author Info       : Hardware Tech at Packard Bell.  I did
                          this in my spare time on New Years Eve,
                          so my buddies and I could deathmatch 
                          for a while.
Description             : Burnt out crater, with surrounding 
                          hallway.  Deathmatch only, no monsters,
                          but suitable weapons.  
                   Doom : Early teleporter testing sight.
                Heretic : Cool crater, no plot.
                  Doom2 : This ones coming, sit tight.
Additional Credits to   : ElcMan and Suicidal Dreams for beta
                          testing with me...

* Construction *

Base                    : Heavily modified TEST.WAD included in the
                          psuedo Doom 1.6 patch.
Editor(s) used          : DEU 5.2gcc, for both games.  Heretic was
                          a pain, let me tell you.  I used a different 
                          node builder, BSP12x I think...
Known Bugs              : None.  If you find any, let me know on IRC
                          or something.
