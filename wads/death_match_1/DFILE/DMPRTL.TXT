Description             : A Portal is an opening... a gate.  In this case it's 
                          not difficult to figure where this gate opens to <g>.
                          This research facility is loaded with heavy armed
                          guards who don't seem to appreciate your presence.
                          They care for your pushing buttons and pulling levers
                          even less.  Maybe they've got the right idea.

                          If you survive you will eventually see the portal - 
                          watch for a change of sorts in an obviously odd
                          structure.  If you dare to - touch the portal.  Run
                          your hands along its surface.  Search its pulsating
                          surface for a hole and stick your arm in....
