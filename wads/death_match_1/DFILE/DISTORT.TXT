Description:             This is a perfect deathmatch level. Designed 
			  after Doom ][ level 1, plus a few ideas of my
			  own. this level incorperates convienient size, 
			  a modest supply of weapons, and a vast variety 
			  of textures to add to the exitment. 
			
			 This level has 5 main rooms with several secret 
			  rooms. I had a group of friends complile their 
			  ideas of what would make a great deathmatch 
			  level onto a peice of paper, and mixed that with
			  Doom ][ level 1. This level is for doom 1.....
