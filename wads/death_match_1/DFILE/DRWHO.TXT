 Here is a Dr Who sound collection taken mainly from the 30th Anniversary
special. The only two sounds not from Dr Who are the pistol, taken from
Captain Scarlet, and the Crikey sound which is taken from The Comic Strips
Five go Mad in Dorset.

 To use the PWAD type: doom -file drwho.wad

 All sounds were sampled at 11kHz using a standard Soundblaster card so 
some sounds may be a little noisy. You shouldn't notice this in the game.
I have used several samples more than once which should help to give a
chorus of Dalek voices.
