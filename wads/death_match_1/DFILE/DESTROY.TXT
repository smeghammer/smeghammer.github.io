Misc. Author Info       : The best Deathmatch wad you've ever played!

Description             : This is my first wad ever. Because I don't
know enough tricks to make it an interesting single player wad, I made
it a D-match. The level is not that pretty. Unaligned textures and the
like. However, the level has been balanced out for great play. There
are no dead ends in this level. Every room connects to another room
for fast, furious fun.
