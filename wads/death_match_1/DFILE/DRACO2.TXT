draco 2...
my next level.
again, i made it primarily for death-match.  it can be played 
alone or even co-op (who wants to do co-op's anyway?).
i've tested it alone and on death-match but never co-op.
it replaces e1m1.
i was surprised to see my last wad in the wadpak series...
i liked seeing it there but the editing was a little wierd.
oh well...
enjoy.
