Misc. Author Info		: Oh, too much to mention.

Description			: My first serious attempt at a wad, also my
				  first uploaded wad.
				  This level is mainly made for deathmatch,
				  however, single play is possible.  I'm not
				  sure about co-op, as I never bother to play
				  it.  The main premise behind the level
				  is windows and more windows to shoot/see 
				  through.  I haven't added the plasma gun,
				  BFG or rocket launcher as I prefer the 
				  shotgun and chaingun in deathmatches.  Also,
				  there are no difficulty levels implemented.
				  Either kill everything or be killed...oh, don't
				  forget to wash your subconscience before and
				  after playing doom.

Additional Credits to		: The author of Edmap.  Also, Johnny Nugnug
				  who happily play tested the level with me.
