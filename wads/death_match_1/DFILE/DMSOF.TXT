Description             : You are Sgt. Kebo Ludo. Member of the elite
			  Special Operation Force left alone in
			  a strange world.  
			  
			  You have to solve how to get to end without 
			  being killed. Not only by defending yourself
			  against all the lovely monsters who want
			  you visit them at HELL. Solve the problem
			  of the Bounty, or the Atztec pryramid &
			  the Phanton of the Opera.

			  I rely on the Shotgun, I think its the best
			  all around weapon, besides Sgt. Ludo is too
			  macho to carry a  Rocket Launcher or
			  a BFG. Those are girly-weapons. Besides
			  solving how to get to the end of each
			  level is sometimes not as easy. 
			  
			  Do NOT attempt to get 100% kills in all 
			  levels, if you do it means you cheated!!! 
			  If you like it, ket me know. This my second 
			  one, and do not know if I am doing ok.
