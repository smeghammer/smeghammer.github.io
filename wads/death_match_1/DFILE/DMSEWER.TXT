DMSEWER.WAD

This WAD file was created from scratch with the DEU 5.1 Doom Editor.
To play, copy DMSEWER.WAD to your Doom directory and enter:

DOOM -FILE DMSEWER.WAD

Then start in episode 2, level 1.
(The WAD will only work with the the registered version by the way)

This is the first WAD file I've made so please forgive me for any
screw-ups you may encounter with it.

Please send any tips, suggestions or comments to me at: SQUIBBLY@AOL.COM

Thanks

-Andy
