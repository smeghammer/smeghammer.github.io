Shameless Plug          : The Virtual Gaming Center (Milwaukee, WI) uses
                          several networks of fast computers with 27" screens
                          and special controllers (steering wheels, flight
                          sticks, etc) to play multi-player games IN-PERSON.

                          The VGC is host to the Offical Mid-West DOOM
                          Tournaments (about every 6 weeks).  You may contact
                          them at:  VGCenter@execpc.com  or  (414) 476-1514.

Description             : Designed to have a demonic presence about it.  You
                          are locked inside an Unholy Cathedral- and only one
                          of you shall survive!

                          There are a couple of "secrets" - but not too many to
                          make it unfair.  My favorate is watching someone
                          burst out from behind the icon-of-hell with a newly
                          aquired BFG 9000.  The placement of all the weapons
                          and bonus items were all well thought out and fair.
                          This wad plays very well in -ALTDEATH and the exit
                          is co-operative.
