Description             : I learned how to make doors finally and so
                          decided to go a little crazy with it. I'm still
                          learning how to use many of the powerful features
                          that are found in DEU and enjoying playing my own
                          creations. There are LOTS of doors to open, and 
                          are secret. As I was creating the game, I found
                          some idiosyncracies in the game that were unexpected
                          and so incorporated them into game play. This
                          is a tough level to play due to the large number
                          of creatures, so be ready!
