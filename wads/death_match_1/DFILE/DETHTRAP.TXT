			: never know when some ammo might come in handy.
			:
			: Look a door! What's behind it? Oh, a bridge 
			: leading to another door. Lets go!! ..... Aargh,
			: a trap, lots of IMPS!!!!
			:
			: Well that describes about 1% of this level. It's
			: big, it's mean. There are many traps, puzzles and
			: effects.
			:
			: Anybody who finishes this level on NIGHTMARE is

			: 100/100/100 no saving. Let me know how you do.
