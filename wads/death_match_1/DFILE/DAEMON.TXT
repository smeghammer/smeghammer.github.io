    ---- Daemon Level ---

"And you thought Imps were bad"


After many many hours of experimentation here is my first

level for the world!


This is version 1.0 of deamon.wad.  It's a standard level

with a small deathmatch component.  I haven't tried it in

deathmatch (yet).


It's got some nasty traps - so watch out!  >:-)


There is one bug in it (I can't fix it as it's the first

intermitent "hall-of-mirrors" I've seen).  One of the

linedefs that is a "2S" becomes an "Im" for some strange

reason during play.  If you find out what causes it,

please email me.  There are also a few texture alignment problems :)


Of course, if you find any bugs - email me :)

(Except texture alignment/texture type bugs - I know about those).


Have fun!
