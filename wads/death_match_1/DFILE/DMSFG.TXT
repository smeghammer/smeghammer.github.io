Well, here it is: 9 completely new Doom levels all play tested and 
ready to go. I have fixed the problem with multi-player games. They 
are all set up for different difficulty levelsand multi-player games. 
I suggest doing them all in order without using any cheat codes. 

To play: 
              Type DMSFG (I made a batch file for you)

              They take over "Knee Deep in the Dead" (so pick that)

              Then choose Ultra Violence (or whatever.....wimp!)

Things to think about: 

1) Most enemies fight each other! (Imperative for level 1)

2) You can't get everything you see.

3) You can't kill 100% of the bad guys on some levels.

4) Don't use cheat codes!

5) Don't spend all your time looking for secrets.  There aren't very many
and they are mostly in obvious places.

6) Try to get through without the temptation of cheat codes.

7) You can kick major demon but on every difficulty level without using
any cheat codes.

8) Save the game a lot on level 8!

Special thanks to:

Raphal Quinet and Brendon Wyber (For giving us DEU 5.0)

Rich Dersheimer "Blackfist" (For his Beginners Guides to DEU)

John Kilgore (For "reluctantly" play testing all the levels)......10-15 times.

Ben Jordan "ME" (For spending about 100 hours of his time to give you
                 a complete set of levels)
So go kick some major demon butt for me. And hey! I spent a lot of time 
creating these levels for you so the least you could do is drop me a note
with any questions, comments and suggestions.  (I hardly get any mail)

And by the way.... I claim no responsability to whatever may happen
to your computer or your brain while playing this game. Good Luck!

P.S. Don't use cheat codes!
