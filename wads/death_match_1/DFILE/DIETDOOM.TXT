Description             : Small, frantic, deadly deathmatch wad.
                          This Wad is meant for only deathmatch 
                          use, I won't be held responsible for 
                          the resulting boredom when playing 
                          single/cooperative.  Contains all 
                          weapons, many teleporters, crossing
                          alleyways, stepping stones, and no
                          big open places.  HEAPS of ammo in
                          the start so keep blasting with that
                          BFG.  Meant for normal deathmatch and
                          1.2 doom because the network machines
                          we run doom on havem't got enough ram
                          for later versions.
