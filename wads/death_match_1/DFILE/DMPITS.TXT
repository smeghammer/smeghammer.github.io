Description             : This is a very early PWAD creation done before DEU 
                          allowed for relocating nodes.  All that has been
                          done is to change linedef types, textures, sector
                          heights, and monster/thing location.  For some
                          reason I get a lot of positive mail of this one.



Special Thanks to     : BRENDON WYBER AND RAPHAEL QUINET for DEU.
