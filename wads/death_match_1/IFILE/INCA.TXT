Description             : After killing yet another Spider Demon, you
begin to wonder how all these demons are getting to this universe, you
already cleared the two anomaly on Phobos and Deimos so where are they
coming from?  You decide to dismiss this thought for now.  When all of a
sudden you open the door and see a Marine on the living marine on the
ground!  You look at the patch on his remains on the sleeve and see the
symbol of your squad!  He gasps when he sees you, he says your name, and
gives a scroll showing the exact location of the nine great anomalys, he
says you must destroy them, it is the only way to stop this madness! 
His breathing becomes very shallow and he lays back and dies, he must of
been the last remaining person from your sqad that is normal, except for
you of course.  You decide to look at the scroll a little closer and
read that all the anomalys are connected by a series of transporters
that go from one to another.  You must destroy these anomalys you must
do it for the yourself and for the world.

I would like to thank the makers of Deu 5.21 for making such a wonderful
editor.  Without it almost all PWads would not be in existance.

I would most like to thank the makers of Deu text 1-4.  Without them
this level or any level I make in the future would not have been
possible without it, thanks Blackfist!!
