                          PLEASE send me your comments, even if it's just
                          to tell me I'm a Dumbo.  (Well it is my first attempt!)
                          All E-Mail will be answered.  
   
Additional Credits      : Rosie (my wife), for looking after me Hand, Foot
                          & Finger, whilst I spend so much time at the keys

                        : Mick & Jodie (my kids) for coping so well since
                          being orphaned, (did you really have to keep
                          bringing your friends in and pointing at me?)

                          for also putting up with my crass E-Mail on a

                          for also demonstrating his capacity at coping with
                          Steep Learning Curves
   

Description             : You're `Acorn Hardas' and you're NO Green Marine.
                          Problem is, the action ain't been too hot of late
                          and you're not one for looking at yourself in a
                          Hall Of Mirrors ;-)   You've been in nothing but
                          trouble with a capital `S' mainly for being Late
                          On Parade, but what do they expect when there's
                          nothing to do but get `spaced out'?

                          Bringing up the rear guard on yet another routine
                          mission, you keep comming across the toasted remains
                          of your buddy's.  Looks like this is the Big One,
                          or is it a scene from that old Twentieth Century,
                          2D Movie you recall, "Planet of the Apes".
                          
                          It's time to prove that you ARE a waster, just like
                          your Captain said, but not quite as he meant...

                                     ---------------------------

                          The file is IMPZONE.WAD and is level E1M1, i.e. 
 		 	  episode 1 mission 1. It supports all levels of
                          violence.  Should prove eminently suited to
                          deathmatch play due to `circuits'.
                          (Unable to test, please let me know).
