Misc. Author Info       : Not my first level, but one of my best..
			  This is a bugfix from V0.1 to 1.1  
			  This is also the "official" release of the level.
			  

Description             :                  IMPS!
			     Yes in this first level, you must stop those
			     pesky imps from draining the powers of the
			     Barons of Impania, and to do that, you
			     must infaltrate the Imp Base and steal the 
			     keys.. then, break into the temple, which has
			     been taken over by the few survivors of this war
			     (The demons), and defeat the barons.
			     To prove that this WILL be an episode, I have
			     included screen shots of the upcoming level:
			     THE QUEEN IMP!.




Additional Credits to   : The usual.  The guys at id, DEU 5.1, and BSP 1.1x.
