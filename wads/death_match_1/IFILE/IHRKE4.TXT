Description             : This PWAD is for E1M1.  It was designed for
	                  deathmatch, which is only way to play DOOM!!

Additional Notes        : This is area is best if played with four
                          players even three, but is probably too big
                          for two players.  This level is a larger level
			  for me, but is my best level to date.  Don't
			  worry there will be more.

                          Please send me any comments or suggestions for 
                          improvement.
