Misc. Author Info       : This is my first attempt at creating
                          a Wad file so its kinda small.

Description             : This PWAD is for E1M1.  It was designed primarily
                          for deathmatch, which is only way to play DOOM!!

Additional Notes        : This is a small area.  The frags add up fast.
                          It's fun if you just want to kick everyones ass
                          and do it quickly.

                          Please send me any comments or suggestions for 
                          improvement.
