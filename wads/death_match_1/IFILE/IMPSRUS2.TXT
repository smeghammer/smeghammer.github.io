Here it is, the sequel! This is actually my fourth level created for the
excellent game DOOM. It is also the best level by FAR, that i have made.
Before i create a level i sit down and try to think up some cool stuff to
put into each area, but this level just kind of grew while it was being 
made. I have read you can run into problems doing things like that, but,
to each thier own. 


This level takes me over 30 minutes to complete. That includes getting all
of the secrets and killing all of the baddies. There are over 320 bad guys
to waste (only in america). This level has deathmatch starting points,but
it was made for the single player and co-op players in mind. There are some
awesome traps in this level, things i have not seen in other levels. This 
level took me about 60 hours (i know, i need a life.... oh by the way im 29..
...i really need a life!) of building and playtesting to make sure YOU will
not have any problems. There is a .bat file included with this, so you won't
have to type out the whole command (1.bat).(with these files in doom directory)

O.K. go play the game let me know what you think, but before you go, i want
you to thank,

ID Software- for the cool game (my way of life).

the DEU guys- Brendon J. Wyber and Raphael Quinet

and last but certainly not least (i have never actually thanked this guy
personally, but i hope he will accept my gratitude in mentioning him)...
envelope please.......drum roll....

to everyone that made "Imps r us" a success, this level is for you.
