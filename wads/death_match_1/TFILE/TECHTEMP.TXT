Misc. Author Info       : This is the first public wad I have made.  I have
made several wads for my friends and myself(for deathmatches) before.
Description             : You are a special forces commando ordered to UAC's
Neural Research Facility where they were using human cells to control some 
computers that were replicating DNA.  One of the chips with the human brain
cells malfunctioned and the cells within replicated horrible monsters from 
the DNA replicators.  Soon after, the guards destroyed the chip but the 
damage was done.  You are to go there and kill all the monsters.  Watch out,
because the place was evacuated so quickly that the intruder alarm/neutralizer
was left on.  The monsters have reportably entered an old cult temple that was
located next to the research center.  You should only leave once all the monsters
are destroyed.  Good luck and good hunting:)

Additional Credits to   :       Dr. Digital(digital@ccnet.com) for lots of 
                                advice and for beta testing it
                                
                                The creators of DEU for a hella rad(and powerful)
                                DooM editing utility.

                                And, of course, to ID software for such a rad
                                game!

* Construction *

Base                    : New level from scratch
Editor(s) used          : DEU
Known Bugs              : A few textures aren't quit aligned along the X axis,
                          and the one in the secret stairwell isn't Y aligned
                          quite right.  In the final room there is one flash 
                          of black effect.  Sometimes the crushing ceilings stop
                          halfway down(I think I fixed this, but I'm not sure).
                          Once Dr. Digital got stuck on a corner in the first
                          blue hall to the right of the start(this *should* be
                          fixed).  Send me E-mail if any others are found.

Misc. Info:
You can get every weapon in this.  There are 3 traps.  Don't be too greedy in
getting the BFG(who knows, you may walk into a trap :)).  In the hall straight
ahead of the start there is a trap primarily designed for Deathmatches(although
you can kill the caco's in it)  take the time to walk through the level and test
the traps before a deathmatch.  Also if someone is holed up in the BFG trap room
you can go there and kill him even if you has the rocket launcher, take a chance.
One final word of caution:  Run like hell in the "garbage compactor" room! Don't
bother with the baddies of your ass is dead.
