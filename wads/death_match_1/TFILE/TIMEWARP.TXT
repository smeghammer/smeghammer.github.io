Description             : This is a deathmatch only level
                          for DOOM I designed with the altdeath
                          mode in mind.  It is a smallish level
                          without the chainsaw, plasma rifle,
                          or BFG.  What it does feature is good
                          solid deathmatch action (what else?).
                          It has been extensively playtested with
                          2-4 players and has gone through a few
                          revisions to arrive at its current
                          state.

Story:   It's deja-vu all over again as you stare at the computer
         terminal this morning.  The program you are working on is
         just not going well and you start to fantasize about a
         tropical island and a tall frosty drink.
         Suddenly a whirling vortex of blue mist yawns open behind
         you!  You are deafened by the roar of the gaping inter-
         dimensional aperature!  Unable to resist the pull you are
         sucked in!
         You find yourself in a pool of water underneath a flashing
         light.
         "Where am I?" you think to yourself.
         You notice to your surprise that a few of your co-workers
         are next to you bathed in similar pools.
         You all get together and discuss the situation.  You quickly
         surmise that you all were thinking of being far away from the
         office at the same precise instant.  The conjunction of this
         energy must have caused a whirling, blue, misty, roaring,
         interdimensional aperature!  AAAAAAHHHHHHH!
         {Ahem}
         Well, to make a long story short, you're in a strange military
         scientific installation of some kind.  And there are some
         demons with you.  And lots of big guns and armor.
         You all find your way out to a circular arena that is open to
         the hostile environs of some alien planet.
         A booming voice bellows:
         "You have been kidnapped by the Fluffy Space Aliens of Renda
         7!!!  You must entertain us by engaging in a little game for
         our amusement (insane cackling).  Run around and kill each
         other for a while.  If we like your style, we may return you
         to your pitiful existences!  Oh, and seeing as we have
         technology far beyond your puny race, we will take steps to
         reverse your deaths in combat.  The pain and suffering, of
         course, must remain for our benefit (more insane cackling)."
         "Yea right!" you all exclaim to each other with meaningful
         glances.  You meet back inside and unanimously agree to not
         comply with the perverse desires of the Fluffy Space Aliens.
          
         But there's not food, you all starve to the point of madness,
         and end up on killing sprees anyway.


Design Notes:  The two switches in the room to the east of the arena
               operate elevators.  The eastern most switch triggers
               an elevator in the far end of the lava pit.  This
               elevator can only be reached by an immediate sprint
               after throwing the switch.  The western-most switch
               operates an elevator in the room immediately to the
               west of the arena.  This area was put in to prevent
               people from lurking and collecting rockets unmolested.


               Let me know what you think of the WAD!
