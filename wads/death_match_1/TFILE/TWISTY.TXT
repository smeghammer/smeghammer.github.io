Title                   : TWISTY.WAD   

Author                  : Chris "The Great Cornholio" Moore

Email Address           : moorec@fire.camp.clarkson.edu

Misc. Author Info       : Overworked undergrad civil engineer slaving 
			  away at Clarkson University, who DOOMS to 
			  retain his sanity. (And builds levels to 
			  exercise the appropriate half of his brain...)

Description             : (Set the mood here.)

	Mood!? What mood? This is DEATHMATCH, plain and simple! You warp
into the level, scoop up some weapons and kill/survive or survive/kill.
This level _is_ rather large in terms of sheer size, so if you deathmatch
with only two people, any meetings will be fleeting and brief... so make
them count! If the other guy runs, dog him, give no quarter!
	*Note* there IS a special cache of weapons and ammo in a secret room,
	but the room won't show up even with the Computer map, so if you do
	find it, guard it wisely. Ammo and weapons strewn generously
	throughout the maze, so Altdeath makes an ammo-rich level even
	richer! No real sniper spots, well... maybe one or two, but probably
	not the kind you are thinking of >;) To the east lies a big-big room
	for flat out slug-a-thons, but the fun lies in hunting down your 
	prey. No dead-ends here, unless you gang up on one poor
	schmuck en-masse.
