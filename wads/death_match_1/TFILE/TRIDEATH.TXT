Misc. Author Info       : My first attempt at any *useful* wad 
                          creation. It may not be really pretty, 
                          but seems to be *very* playable. 

Description             : Deathmatch wad that is meant to use 
                          the -altdeath parameter. An lmp is
                          included to "walk" you through.
