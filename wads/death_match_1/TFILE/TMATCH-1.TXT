Description             : This is a tight little wad with lots of narrow
                          cooridors and a couple secrets. All of the weapons
                          are available, although the rocket launcher and the
                          BFG are a bit of a *pain* to get. There's a couple
                          little goodies thrown in, like the micro-maze room.

Author's Notes:

 Not much, just that this is a pretty high action wad. Single player on UV
 proves to be rather tough, but rather playable (no CyberDemons or Spideys)
 I'd much appreciate any insults, jeers, threats, suggestions or compliments
 that you have about this level.        
        Hope you like it.
        -Tom.
