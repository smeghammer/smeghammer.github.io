Description             : I have made a lot of quicky deathmatch 
                          and co-op levels.  This is my first single-
                          player level.  I worked a LONG time on this
                          level, and it's pretty big.  It consists of 
                          4 main areas.  The first is the entance hall,
                          the second is to get the keycard to get to the
                          3rd and so forth.  I didn't implement skill
                          levels, but it CAN be ended alone on Ultra-
                          Violence, I have tested it, as well as some of
                          my doom buddies.  I added in extra monsters and
                          weapons for multiplayer <cyber-demon>.  I suggest
                          you play with no monsters when playing death-
                          match.  I also put in many secret area's, so try
                          and find those.  This is my first "professional"
                          level, so I'd appreciate any comments about what
                          you think of it.
