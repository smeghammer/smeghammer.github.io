Misc. Author Info       : This is my 4th WAD file that I have uploaded to 
			  Cserve. 7th if you want to count the ones I've
			  done but have mysteriously crashed during editing.
			  Send me E-mail about how you like it or dislike it.

Description             : After fighting your way through the first infested
			  level of the UAC's corrupted training program, you
			  discover little clues as to why your here or what they
			  want from you. Now your on the second level of the 
	                  program, and it looks as if this will be another tough
			  fight. One things for sure, those bastards will pay
			  once you find them...if you do. 	

Additional Credits to   : iD for Doom, and well, I don't want to sound conceded
		          here, but, there really was no outside help.
