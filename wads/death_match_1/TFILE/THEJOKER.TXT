The Joker for Deathmatch!

I personally would like to Welcome you to the first in a series of
customized PWAD files created for use with the  Registered Version
of ID's virtual reality game DOOM.  The Joker is best run on a 486
CPU not so much because of map size, but because of detail and the
configuration for  multi-player in  deathmatch mode.  The map does
contain 1 single player start so that you can practice your moves,
the traps, and your  escape routes  before you plunge yourself and
your deathmatch partners into battle! It is highly recommended you
practice running through The Joker  unless you and your deathmatch
partners are equally  "untrained" on this map! Not a lot of secret
doors nor invisible areas on the map (TAB)  so that there is truly
a "fair advantage" ... yet plenty  of tricks that the  experienced
deathmatch player can appreciate! BTW, there is NO EXIT! Suggested
play should be to a pre-determined  number of frags or exhaustion.

Enjoy,

Vance Andrew Blevins

P.S. This file THEJOKER.ZIP has been released on 6/13/94, look forward
     to the next in the series, "Barrel Mission - The First 2 Missions"
     (BARMIS2.ZIP) coming out in late June '94...
