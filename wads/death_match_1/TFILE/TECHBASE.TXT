Misc. Author Info       : This is my first WAD. Please tell me 
                          how you feel about it!!!!

Description             : After the "Doom" incident an interplanetary
                          war was sparked between the Humans and the
                          creatures from Hell.  You were sent on a
                          mission to a major enemy military installation
                          to gather intelligence....but you were 
                          captured.  Sl`Tek Kor, Commander of the 121st
                          Infantry (also a spider daemon), found you
                          lurking around and imprisioned you....but not
                          before you were able to find out that a major
                          weapons shipment is about to take place.

                          You find yourself now inside the holding cell in
                          the military compound.  A drop ship has arrived 
                          and the weapons are being loaded on by Sl`Tek Kor
                          himself.  You've gotta find a way inside that
                          drop ship and get to wherever those weapons are
                          headed.  Wherever it is.....it's gotta be BIG...

                          Read the file TECHBASE.STY included in the zip
                          to get a complete background.  It also includes
                          useful info concerning the presence of Sl`Tek Kor.
                          (Play the WAD.....you will understand then...)

* Construction *

Base                    : I found a pack of wads on a BBS. One of the
                          levels had no monsters in it.  No deathmatch
                          spots....no nothing.  I took it....played with
                          it....and came up with this...
                          
Build Time              : About a day (not counting DEU 5.2 learning time)  
Editor(s) used          : DEU v5.2
Known Bugs              : There was a strange texture glich but it hasn't
                          shown up for about an hour so it should be gone.
                          <G> The textures should be aligned (I made it
                          a priority to learn texture alignment BEFORE my
                          first release.).
