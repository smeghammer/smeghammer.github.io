DESCRIPTION
-----------

THE_GRID.WAD is a specially designed 4 player deathmatch level.  
It's a large level, but you don't end up wandering around 
looking for your opponent for hours on end.  (I hate that)
The only advanced weapons that are available are the chain gun
and the shotgun.  I added monsters to the level so single player
play is enjoyable, but the level is really designed for multiplayer
cooperative or deathmatch play.  It's a straight up, knock down, drag 
out shooter.  Do whatever you want with this level, but if you really
screw with it take my name off of it.  If someone decides to include 
this in some special deathmatch episode or something, I'd like you 
to put my name in some sort of documentation so I can feel important.  
If you really like this level give it to someone who likes playing 
four player DOOM or, if you feel the need, send me a WAD that you made.
If anyone has any problems with this level, especially 3 or 4 players
(I don't have access to a network) please drop me e-mail with the
nature of the problem....maybe I can fix it.
