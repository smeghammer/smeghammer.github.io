INFO:                   : This is my first (and largest) level.
                          
Description             : This level was primarily intended for 
                          solo. Deathmatch is supported. There are many ambush
                          points and ways to double back on your opponent
                          so you should use most of them when playing.
                          (Especially helpful for those demons who like to
                          follow you!) DONT GET LOST! 
                          Happy Dooming!
