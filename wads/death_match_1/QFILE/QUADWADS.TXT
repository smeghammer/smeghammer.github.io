All three of these wads are designed the same; one for Doom 1,
one for Doom 2, and one for Heretic.  It is a fast paced level
that usually results in a lot of frags.  The layout of the walls
and destination of the transporters is identical in all three
levels, so if you learn one - you've learned them all.  After many
hours of,... ah,... "testing", we've found that this is one of
the best layouts for deathmatch play.
