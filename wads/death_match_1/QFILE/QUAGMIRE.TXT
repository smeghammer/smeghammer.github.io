Misc. Author Info       : Just a guy who loves Doom and drinks entirely to 
                          much diet Dr. Pepper.

Description             : Just a level that got me into wad building and 
                          to learn DEU 5.21.  I just kept adding things I 
                          liked and seeing if my play testers could get 
                          through them.  There's plenty of ammo and a few 
                          tricks to figure out. 

Additional Credits to   : The guys at id, the guys that made DEU 5.21 and 
                          BSP 1.2x.  Robb Bentley for play testing the level
                          over and over and over again.
