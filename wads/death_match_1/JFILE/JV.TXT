Author                  : Owen Robertson
Email Address           : None (Reachable via Software Creations BBS)
Misc. Author Info       : Fifth WAD file, age 16, lives with parents
                          in Caribou, Maine, has good teeth, etc...
Storyline               : You awake to find yourself trapped in a small
                          room.  You remember only that you must leave
                          this place quickly or die.  Thus, you do.
Description             : A revolutionary new wad file for registered doom
                          (of course) that has many unheard-of features,
                          such as the revolving stairway of death, ladders
                          (sorta), working elevators, secrets galore, etc.  
                          For some less experienced users who may want help 
                          finding their way through (WIMPS!) I've included 
                          8 .PCX files that show all the secrets and hidden
                          doors/switches in the level.  Erase them now if you
                          have any dignity.

* Construction *

Base                    : New level from scratch
Build Time              : Almost 2 months (135 revisions!)
Editor(s) used          : DEU 5.21, BSP 1.1
Known Bugs              : Um, well sometimes the revolving stairway doesnt
                          work right, but only occasionally.  I cant fix it,
                          even after revising it over and over.  If it screws
                          up, it will HOM, but if I fix that, it wont work at
                          all.  Otherwize, no real bugs or anything that I
                          can think of.
