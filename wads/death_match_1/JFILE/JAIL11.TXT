Description             : This is my first DOOM-Level. It has been
			  developed with DEU 5.1 and 5.2 on a
			  486DX2/66. It has only been tested for
			  single play.
			  You start near the properly locked prison.
			  Something strange has happened there and
			  the warders who managed to escape won't
			  let you in (this should set you thinking).
			  Find the key and ....

Hints			: The Ultraviolence setting is tough
			  because you have not too much ammo. Try
			  an easier one first.
			  The switch near the staircase must be
			  used several times ;-)

Additional Notes        : If you have any suggestions or ideas, please
                          email.
