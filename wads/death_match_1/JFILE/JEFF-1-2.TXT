This pwad is a modification of e1m2 and was designed specifically for
deathmatch. This means there are no enemies! However, the *entire* level
has been changed...all of the textures, objects, etc. So even if you aren't
playing deathmatch, give it a try to go exploring to see if you can recognize
the map at all. There are a minimum amount of weapons (everything but BFG)
scattered in hidden places, which I think makes for good deathmatch play.
There are also several teleporters added. Have fun!

P.S. This was made with newdeu4.31. When deu5.0 comes out, I plan to create
     a map of the University of Texas...watch for it!
