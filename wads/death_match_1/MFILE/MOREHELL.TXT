Description             : This level is the revision of 11inhell.wad.
                         If you are a fan of that one, then delete it and use
                         this instead.  This level was built _just_
                         for deathmatches. It has several _main_ rooms 
                         with numerous sniper spots, teleports, and 
                         visial effects.  It takes two people to open the 
                         exit.  This level also has "hell" and a special 
                         room that lets you look at all major areas.  It is
                         also small enough to let you find the other player
                         quickly to rack up the frags.  There are numerous
                         connections between the rooms so you won't end up 
                         running for miles.  Email me with any questions.
