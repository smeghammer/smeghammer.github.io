Description             : This is my first wad built with DEU and BSP
                          It's not a huge wad but it has it's moments.
                          When the IMPS start appearing start blasting.

                                     ---------------------------

                          The file is MIKE1.WAD and is level E1M1.
                          There is only a player 1 start. So it's a solo
                          mission.

Disclaimer              : Tested thru and thru. no problems that I'm
                          aware of.
