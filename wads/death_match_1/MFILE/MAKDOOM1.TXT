Description             : One classic Doom level complete with
                          all three keys, traps, secret doors,
                          and of course, lots of targets.  This
                          level is an attempt to mirror the
                          mood and detailed maps that made the
                          original game so much fun.  Stress 
                          was placed on QUALITY.  Some WAD
                          files floating around have a thrown
                          together feel.

                          This should only be used with the 
                          registered version of Doom as it
                          replaces the second episode.
