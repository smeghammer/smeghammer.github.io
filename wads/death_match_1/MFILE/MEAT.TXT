Description             : It's a fast moving adventure with lots of monsters, 
			  hidden goodies, secret rooms, and a few traps.  
			  Many hours were spent creating and playtesting.   
			  It's an E3M5 substitution. Supports single and 
			  multiplayer or Deathmatch mode.  Difficulty 
			  settings are implemented as Easy/Med., and Hard.  
			  Have fun, watch your back,  and send your comments.  
			  I'd love to hear them.  
Additional Credits to   : Kurt, for playtesting, ideas and not minding if 
			  some of the cleaning wasn't done.... MegaDeath 
			  Marty for playtesting,  and Karl, for taking naps 
			  and playing nicely while mommy fixes "just one 
			  more thing.....",
