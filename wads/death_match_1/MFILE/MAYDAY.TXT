Description             : Seven days ago the "Mayfair" issued a distress call.
			  The Mayfair is a deep exploratory vessel and is
			  currently scouting a black hole in sector 95.
			  Garbled reports of the distress call reported
			  an unknown race of aliens attacking the ship.  
			  You are being sent as part of an UAC task force 
			  to assist the Mayfair. Good luck.
Additional Comments     : This is my first try at a doom level and any 
			  comments or suggestions would be appreciated.
