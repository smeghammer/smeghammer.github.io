*****************   WELCOME TO MIA.WAD V 1.0 ****************************

Set in the jungles of SouthEast Asia, this is a dark, intense level.  Lots of
doors to open, secret places, neat effects, and even a magic trick. (Hint, 
magic near rocket launcher).  Watch your six!!!

To play this PWAD file, unzip it into the directory where you put DOOM, and 
start DOOM like this:

DOOM -DEVPARM -FILE MIA.WAD -SKILL 3 -WARP 1 1

This will take you right into the level at "Hurt Me Plenty" difficulty 
setting.

If you don't want/need to warp right to the level, then use the following:

DOOM -FILE MIA.WAD      

For those of you with DEU 5.2 or better, you may want to resave this one as
E1M9.  I am distributing it as E1M1 because it is easier for the average user
to check it out that way.

DEATHMATCH:

Haven't been able to try it yet.  The doomers around here always have real
(the nerve of them) work to do lately.  Someone please try it out and tell
me what you think.  I think there are some good ambush spots, and I have 
tried to put the weapons in places that will discourage people from just 
waiting there to ambush others seeking that weapon.

You have been sent on a covert mission to rescue some of your buddies from
'Nam that were previously reported MIA, but sources now reveal their location
at a secret camp deep in the jungle.

After stealthilly (is that a word?) making your way into the camp, you 
discover that your old friends have gone over the deep end, and are now 
either participants or subjects of mean, nasty, evil experiments with forces 
from the great beyond. (Beyond what?  Cleveland maybe, I don't know).

You reluctantly decide to rid the world of these vermin and their evil
activities.

On "Hurt Me Plenty", "Ultimate" or "Nightmare" mode, you will eventually run 
into Col. Smith. 

He has been transformed into a CyberDemon.  After a brief meeting, you may 
encounter him again before you exit.

Although you do not have to kill Col. Smith to get out, for you real DOOM 
badasses, it would be quite a challenge to do so.  There are more than enough 
rockets for the job.

There are not any Plasma Guns or BFG9000's laying around, so don't waste your 
time looking for them.  You are going to be too busy looking around corners, 
over your shoulder, and running alot just to make it out alive.

No, this level is not exactly saturated with vermin, but they are 
concentrated in some key areas.

On "Ultimate" and "Nightmare" mode, there will be four (count 'em, 4 ) 
wandering, teleporting Barons you will have to deal with.  Have a nice day.

When you look up out of one of the staircases, you may see some visual 
glitches at the top of the larger buildings on the left or right.  I don't 
know why this is happening.  It is the first such problem I've run into that 
BSP did not completely clean up.

If anyone figures out why this is happening or what I may have done wrong, 
please let me know.


Have fun!

Rick
