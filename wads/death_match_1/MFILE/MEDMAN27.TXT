Title:			Medicine Man  (MEDMAN27.WAD)
Author:			Kim Markworth
Misc Author Info:	Aged 30 years, (I sound like a wine,) graphic
			artist/systems analyst/DJ type who is more
			addicted to this game than any professional
			should be--and are there any other GIRLS out
			there who love this game?  I think we're in the
			minority...
WAD Description:	Not much to say.  Second WAD I've done.  BADBLU34
			was the first--nothing but a carnagefest.  This
			one was a try at the special effects; if you love
			teleporters you'll like it.  As you play, watch
			the map develop...     Hence, the name.
Additional Credits:	ID, of course (I'd rather play 'em than make 'em)
			Matt T., for creating DOOMCad
			Carr T., for endlessly testing my WADs while he
			shakes his head and says, "Why don't you just let
			ID do it?"  Touche.
