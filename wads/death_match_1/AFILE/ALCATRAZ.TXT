                          ASSAULT on ALCATRAZ!


   Welcome to another production by Critical Edge.  I hope you liked 
   MURDER2, my first level.  


   The story so far...

   -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

   You are J.R., a member of the elite Delta Force.  Your group is
presently inflight to San Francisco after a very short and tense briefing.
It appears the rumors were true.  And the reality is even worse.  

   A year ago some special "prisoners" were captured.  Where and how were
never revealed.  These prisoners, however, were quite different from us and
could not be reasoned with.  The old Alcatraz prison, an island off the
California coast, was quietly renovated and with the highest of security
held the prisoners for observation.  Until now.  A full scale revolt took
place eight hours ago.  It seems that one group of inmates, with brown
scales and claws, could inflict a nerve poison through scratches.  The
guards were overpowered and apparently, because of the poison, are now
teamed up with the revolt. Fortunately, escape from Alcatraz has never been
documented.  Your team is to regain control of the island and allow no 
escapes...AT ALL COST!  

   You check your parachute buckles as you are motioned to the howling open
jump door.  The tiny island is barely visible below you in the thick fog
as a hand on your shoulder signals your turn.  You leap.  The descent is
a chilling one.  Ominous dark shapes dart through the waters below and the
prison grounds are littered with bodies.  As you pull your cord, warning 
shouts come from the prison.  The billowing American flag below gives you the
warning to pull hard to the right as you drift directly over the main
building.  You look back to see your buddies 'chutes catch the downdraft
you just avoided.  Helplessly you watch as they plummet directly into the
assembly grounds.  A snipers bullet from one of the guard towers catches
you in the leg as you clear the building and drop to the ground outside
dangerously close to the cliff edge. Damn, who shot me? The screams and 
gunfire fade. Hastely, you unbuckle your harness and enter the prison from 
the guards entrance.  

   You place your riot gun on the deck as you expertly bandage your leg.
Just a flesh wound.  The din of metal cups and utensils being pounded on the
tables in the cafeteria beyond is deafening. You hope your buddies are 
okay as you start in...
