                          This is my FIRST WAD File Ever. I have tried many
                          Times to make a good WAD, but I never knew about
                          DEU until a little while back.. So now my WAD
                          Making life is now a lot, Let me emphasize LOT
                          Easier.

Description             : Simply Put, A Deathmatch Level With BYTE.
                          Nothing fancy, Just 6 Different playing fields
                          loaded with ammo, weapons, and bonuses.  The health
                          is not as heavy, nor are the monsters. Thats why 
                          it's an excellent Deathmatch wad. NO DOORS, Or 
                          Lifts. I like the even playing field, with the 
                          exception of SNIPER POINTS <G>. Lot's of Warps, so
                          you can hear your apponent, but wont know which 
                          warp to take.. Oh Yea!, The Name of the WAD File
                          Reflects the Name Of The Music I incorporated into
                          this WAD.. Pretty Cool!! Another Strong point to 
                          this WAD File is the NARROW Hallways, and pass-
                          through's. If your aim isnt exact, it could very
                          well kill you in the end... He He!
                          NO HIDDEN ROOMS IN THIS WAD... Why? It's Deathmatch
