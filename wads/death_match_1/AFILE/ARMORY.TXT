I would also like to thank Rapha‰l Quinet, and all those who worked with him
for making available DEU 5.21 (and previous versions).  Without this great
editor, this wadfile would not have been possible.
If you don't have the latest version of DEU, you can get it via anonymous FTP
from:
        bear.montefiore.ulg.ac.be
        \pub\doom\deu

I would also like to thank ID Software for creating Doom, and occupying so
much of my time.  Now, if they can just figure out a way for me to get some
kind of college credit for playing!!!
