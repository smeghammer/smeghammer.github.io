Argh! Level 1

This level was created as a simple demonstration of the capabilities of
Renegade Graphics Doom Editor.  It was created with version 1.0b.

I suggest you play through it once without looking at the map.  See if you 
can figure out what original level it is based on.  You will find it
difficult.

This level was designed for single or cooperative play, not deathmatch,
though it could be used.  It is not really suitable as there are a number
of traps which are one-way.

This will work with the registered version of Doom 1.2 only.
