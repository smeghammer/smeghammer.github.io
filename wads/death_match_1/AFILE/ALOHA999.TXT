General Comment:  
                
                DEU/DOOM has taken over my life...  again.  
                
                For the final time...  for the time being.

                Needed to see if I could do a whole episode.
                Needed to see if I could capture the Doom "essence".

                YES two times.

                (Aloha911.wad was creative but...  different)
                              
                Any/all comments greatly appreciated.

                Doom is for life.  Doom IS life!
