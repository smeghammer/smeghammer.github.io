Misc. Author Info       : 30 year old father of two with a wife
			  who is starting to hate DOOM with a 
                          passion!

Description             : A small wad suitable for playing either
                          stand-alone or (preferably) altdeath.
                          Single player is pretty easy (I was
                          able to beat UV and ended up with 100%
                          health).

                          The wad got its name from a situation
                          where Tim and I were both in the opposing
                          hidden passages facing each other
                          (unknowingly) and fired on Guy (who was
                          racing down the passage).  We both
                          missed him and took out each other!

Additional Credits to   : Tim Cook and Guy Parker for helping me
                          play test this puppy.
