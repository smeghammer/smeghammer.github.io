666epis.wad
===========

Well, I wanted to make a whole episode, but time constraints got the
better of me.  This mini-episode contains the previously released levels
666 and 777 as levels 3 and 4.  There are 3 other new levels.  The levels
do not appear in the order I created them (666 was first).  So, the
level of ... detail differs quite a bit.  In particular 666 doesn't
fit in quite as nicely as the others, but it is included for historical
reasons.

You should NOT be able to get stuck anywhere (unless you die there --
an acid pit for example).  And the only pits where you can get stuck are 
the start of level 4 (formerly 777) and the room with the long catwalk in
level 3 (formerly 666).

Description             : A mini-episode consisting of 5 levels.
                          Replaces E3M4 through E3M8.  A batch file
                          is included to start the episode.  Just
                          unzip the file into the DOOM directory
                          and type 666.  It will give instructions
                          on how to use the batch file (you have to
                          give it a number indicating the difficulty
                          level). 

                          More hell is the basic theme.  You start at
                          the "home" of the spider-demon, but he is
                          nowhere to be found.  Find him, kill him,
                          the end.  Simple.  Right?
