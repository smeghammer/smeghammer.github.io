Description             : This is a DEATHMATCH 2.0 pwad.
                          Please play this wad with -altdeath only.
                          There are all weapons and an exit.
                          Monsters: one Trooper :)
                           (try to keep the Trooper alive while
                            playing deathmatch)
                          
Info                    : This is my latest Deathmatch pwad.
                          The level is very compact, so you
                          won't search to long to get a frag.
                          I hope this level reaches the
                          gameplay qualities of peace_20.wad.
                          I'm not sure about that, because
                          i build it without much playtesting.
                                                                                       
Additional Credits to   : Ayrton Senna for being the greatest
                          racing driver ever.
                          Everyone who enjoyed my prior levels
                          peace and peace_20.
                          James Dicke for the deathmatch charts.
                          ID for DOOM.
                          The whole internet for being there.
                          The little trooper in this pwad for
                          running around.
