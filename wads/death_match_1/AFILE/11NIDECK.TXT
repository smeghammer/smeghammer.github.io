Description             :

 "Burg Nideck ist im Elsa· der Sage wohlbekannt,
 die Hîhe, wo vorzeiten die Burg der Riesen stand;
 sie selbst ist nun verfallen, die StÑtte wÅst und leer,
 und fragst Du nach den Riesen, du findest sie nicht mehr."
                              -- Das Riesenspielzeug, Adelbert von Chamisso

 Castle Nideck ist so large and crudely hewn that it is said to have been
 built be giants in prehistoric times. And prehistoric it sure is - it's
 been sitting deep in the mountains for as long as mankind can remember,
 dark and foreboding.
 A few months back, activity was reported inside the castle - screams and
 moans, weird lights and evil laughter. It was discounted as the usual
 talk, until the day a whole village disappeared and you were sent to
 investigate...

 Note: While this is not on of these Look-how-many-monsters-I-can-throw-at-
       you WADs, it _is_ very difficult in UltraViolent, especially in Multi-
       Player games. Try Hurt Me Plenty first, it's the level I designed
       it for.

However, you ARE NOT allowed to charge any kind of money for it, not

seen from some sleazy ShareWare vendors, and I don't want anyone to make

Meaning, if you charge money to distribute this (BBS special access,

there are plenty other good ones around.
