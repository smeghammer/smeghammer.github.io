Description             : Cool deathmatch level in an arena with
                          2 main areas in the middle and
                          walkways going round the outsides. 
                          Best deathmatch level ever!  

Additional Credits to   : My dad (Steve Zadarnowski) for the
                          concept of the level, he drew it, I
                          made it work!

Known Bugs              : Well, when you stand at certain angles
                          in some places (ie: against walls) and 
                          look around really slowly, or stop at
                          certain angles, _slight_ HOM's appear..  
                          Nothing really tragic because its a 
                          deathmatch level and its not MADE for 
                          standing  around to enjoy the scenery!  
                          But if anyone can tell me how to fix this 
                          minor problem, please e-mail me!

Comments                  I've seen a few good wads suitable for
                          deathmatch, but have been annoyed by a
                          lack of weapons and ammo.  I go for the
                          kill-em-good approach, which means
                          plenty of rockets and plasma all round.
                          For more immediate kills, machine gun is
                          good for stealth.  A shotgun is handy,
                          and a chainsaw just for good measure.
                          As for the map, I like room to run but
                          a few places to hide, for a few seconds
                          anyway! Couple of hidden doors and the
                          exit, of course.

                          Also, a little surprise in store. I won't
                          tell you what, but you'll soon find out
                          when playing deathmatch.
