Somebody requested a deathmatch arena of huge proportions with a
catwalk.  Well this is a close as I could get.  This is huge!

Each player starts (deathmatch or cooperative) in a hall at each
of the four corners.  Every weapon is present and a ton of monsters.
Since this was designed specifically to be a deathmatch game, there
is no exit.

To run type:

doom -file arena.wad

If you don't want any of the monsters type:

doom -file arean.wad -nomonsters

This is a self-extracting archive called arena.exe.  It contains this
text file and the wad file.

This pwad was built with Deu 5.0 and bsp 1.0.

PS There is some oddness in one corner that makes walls appear that
don't exist.  This happens when Deu and/or BSP are run on the file.
I don't know why, if some one can tell me I'd be greatful.  I'm
wondering if the level is too big?
