Description             : 303 (Denver Colorado Area Code)
                          Design based on blue prints of
                          actual 303. This is the first of
                          many 303 levels I will do, and I will
                          eventually replace a few textures
                          with some of my own.
                   -----> If the game runs to slowly, um, buy a 
         IMPORTANT!-----> 486 or something.

Known Bugs              : The Scrolling walls look lame because
                          you can see like where the texture ends
                          and starts. I'm working on that. Also,
                          Once you shoot in the first level, 
                          all bad guys know your there and 
                          come after you. Also, E2M2 lags
                          quite a bit in the maze.
