Description             : E2M1 :- Trigger Happy !!

			  This level is a semi-hard, very brain
			  tasking level, it is the sort of level
			  that you rip your hair out trying to
			  find the secret doors/rooms, keys, etc.,
			  very bloodthirsty, if you like kick'n
			  DEMON BUTT, this level is for you !!!!

Additional Credits to   : Thanks VERY much to Greg Lewis for the
			  loan of the status bar graphics, also
			  if you are in the area, pull a copy of
			  TREE3.WAD from the site at the end of
			  this file, it is a very good set of levels
			  and well worth a copy, so, thanx again
			  to Greg.
