Description             : 3 levels of descent into hell, It starts off 
                        fairly nice, and gets more and more sick (so I 
                        am told).

                        Featuring:

                        Ambushes
                        The lair of the darkness beast
                        The circle of death
                        The abatoir (now you know why all those chainsaws are 
                                lying around in hell)
                        The Lecture Theatre of hell (what goes on in the 
                                chemistry department at night)
                        Secrets (that don't show up on the map)

Additional Credits to   : All the people that gave me endless amusement by
                        dying horribly
