[ note from swhiting@cix.compulink.co.uk on posting this to CIX ].

This zip file, on download from CIS, was originally called DMOVL.ZIP and 
contained two identical WAD files, called CHUMP and FILTH.  I've renamed
FILTH as OVERLORD, as appears to have been the original author's
intentions, and repackaged as OVERLORD.ZIP
