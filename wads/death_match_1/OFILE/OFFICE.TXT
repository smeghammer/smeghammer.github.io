Description:

                What makes this level so interesting is it's
        'office'-building highrise design (thus the name).  There 
        are 5 floors that are nearly identical.  Each floor has an 
        up and down 'elevator' which is actually a teleporter.  If 
        you didn't know that doom doesn't allow it, you'd swear 
        this level has multiple floors!
                This WAD is for those of you who are tired of all 
        the huge, complicated, nearly impossible, and frustrating 
        levels out there.  THIS WAD is designed to be FUN.  Isn't 
        that what games are all about anyway?  EVERY weapon is 
        available, sustaining health is available, and every enemy
        makes an appearance!
                Also, for those of you who HATE poorly aligned 
        textures, I spent time to make sure I didn't irritate you!

Some tips:

               -If you happen to find the key to the basement,
        enjoy the slaughter of large numbers of troopers!  It's
        always fun to blow them away after you've developed an
        arsenal!
               -There is an easy trick to finishing the level (if 
        you don't cheat), so don't get upset when you see cyberdemon
        standing in your way!
               -Take the time to look out the window on each level.
        I tried to give the impression of a 'high rise.'
               -You can tell what floor you are on by the number 
        of red lites on the wall across from the elevators.
