Description             : An alteration of doom episode
                          one, mission one.  Rooms have been
                          added and joined to make for an excellent
                          deathmatch game.  Friends and I have spent
                          two hours straight on this one floor.
                          A tower has been added to the courtyard.
                          How do you get in and out of this thing?

                          This floor is not too big so the frag and
                          excitement level is high.

                          caution : do not play if you have a heart
                                    condition
