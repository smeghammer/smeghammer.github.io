Content:        hangar.wad      e1m1 pwad - Doom v1.666
                hangar.lmp      recording at skill 1

Usage:          1) Unzip hangar.zip in the directory of your choice. 
                2) Use the indicated command line from your Doom v1.666
                   directory.
                   
                   Note: <path> is not required if hangar.zip
                   is unzipped in your doom v1.666 directory. Also
                   note that the .lmp extension should be omitted from
                   the recording file name.
                   Type the following:

                   doom -file <path>hangar.wad -playdemo hangar

                3) then press <Return> twice to clear the modified pwad
                  warning and away you go.

Skill Levels:   Yes, but perhaps rather crudely.
Multi-Player:   Yes.
Deathmatch:     I think so, but never played it as such.
Plot:           Get outta here!

Comment:        Some parts of the pwad are rather unfinished I'm afraid, but
                the demo seems to gun along quite well.
