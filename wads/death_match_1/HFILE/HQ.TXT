Description             : This level may be played all by itself
                          as the second level of the second game,
                          but is intended to be played as the
                          second level after the "CANYON.WAD"
                          (At the end of CANYON.WAD, you're loaded
                          up with ammo, etc., which is particularly
                          useful for less-experienced players who
                          are playing at a higher-difficulty level)

Base                    : New level from scratch
Build Time              : 40 hours
Editor(s) used          : DoomCad version 4.3, BSP version 1.1 for nodes
Known Bugs              : I ran out of time to tweak all of the
                          wall patterns, so pay attention to your
                          map in order not to miss any secrets.

                          Towards the end, at the bottom of two
                          elevators, it exhibits the problem of
                          flashing the ceiling pattern adjacent to
                          a wall > 504 units. This is usually not
                          noticable.

                          There seems to be a problem saving this
                          level from time to time. I've seen this
                          same problem with other .WAD's, but don't
                          know what causes it. Most times it saves
                          just fine, but occasionally I have seen
                          the message:

                                SAVEGAME BUFFER OVERFLOW
                                MEMORY ALLOCATION ERROR
                                CANNOT LOAD COMMAND. SYSTEM HALTED
