Description: 
     This level doesn't work as well as anything but the first level in an
episode (a purely esthetic consideration, to be sure), as the players start
out outside the structure. This doesn't prevent you from moving it
elsewhere; it's just an incongruous transition.

     This is a thinking player's level; there's a puzzle built into the
design. You are shown the soul sphere for the level; it's in plain view
almost at the start. Your problem is to get to it; there are several things
you have to do in order to get to it, and if you don't do it right, you'll 
never be able to reach it. In addition, you will probably cut yourself out 
of getting 100% secrets and kills unless you solve the puzzle.

     The design of the level had to be stripped down in one spot from my
original design; I ran up against the rendering engine's 'sector-in-sector'
limitation, and had to rework it -- and rework it, and rework it, when 
earlier attempts to solve the problem failed -- in order to prevent HOM
wierdness.

The level has been designed so that it is impossible, even in a multiplayer 
game with the players splitting up and running all around the level, for a 
player to get trapped so they can't get to the exit or are stuck in a sector 
that sucks away their health.
