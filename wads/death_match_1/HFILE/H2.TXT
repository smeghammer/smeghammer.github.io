                        Bart's House 2.0
                        By Bart McEndree

        Here is the second edition of the family favorite BRTHOUSE.WAD. This
is a DOOM PWAD of E1L1. Created using DEU 5.0 and tested with the registered
version of DOOM v1.1. This PWAD only works with the registered versions of
DOOM. This version of Bart's house corrected many bugs using BSP 1.0. Also
added are secret areas that utilize Duck Blinds much like the sniper nest in
E1M1 of DOOM.WAD v1.2. There are 8 of them. Consider this a challenge <G>.
There is one of them that can only be entered with the help of another player.
This level has been optimized for multi-player deathmatches.
