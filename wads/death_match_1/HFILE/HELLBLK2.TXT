Title                   : HellBlok 2   
Filename                : HellBlk2.WAD
Author                  : Sean

Description             : This WAD file is the sequel to my first WAD file,
                          HellBlok.wad. There are a few new texture mapped
                          walls in this episode - nothing too fancy. If you
                          enjoy HellBlok 2, check-out the first HellBlok.

                          You start out the game with you and your buddies
                          confined to a containment area. Player one has
                          just blown away a Trooper and has aquired the
                          Blue Keycard. For those of you playing HellBlok 2
                          in Cooperative Mode, whoever starts the game off
                          as Player 1 must open the cells containing the
                          other Players. If not, then they'll just rot there,
                          and that's no fun - or is it?
                          
                          There are 2 Exits out of HellBlok 2. At the Demon
                          Convention, jump through the fast blinking Gate
                          for an additional Blood-Slaughtering episode.

                                                Peace in Hell - Sean.
