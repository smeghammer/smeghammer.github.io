Description             : This is much improved version of halls.wad.
                        It's a fairly big level for two player
                        deathmatch, but we still find it extremely fun
                        to play even with only two players. It contains
                        a lot of teleports, and some of them take you to
                        the prison, where you're just a sitting duck for
                        your opponent(s) to take out. The level is chock
                        full of items, especially stim and med packs
                        last forever...and your chances of running out
                        of ammo are almost zero.

Ending words: You can only exit if you have at least two players in
the game and they both co-operate to exit. The first player must press
the switch in the sniping-area which is located in the computer area,
which opens the door next to the skin switch..Then, the other player,
who is waiting there, presses the skin switch besides the door which has
just opened, and the way to exit switch is all clear!
