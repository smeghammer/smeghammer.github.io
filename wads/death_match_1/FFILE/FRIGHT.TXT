Heyyyyyy,

This is the first of my (hopefully) many levels. If I get good feedback,
 I'll keep working on and posting them.

Fright.wad represents countless hours of testing both by me and the
guys here at work (after-hours of course....).  It was built with
 network play in mind, but (I think) it should be possible to complete
in single player mode.  

It fits into E2M1 (in accordance with Id's rules) and has no "skill level"
discrimination (not worth the time to change all the thing definitions)...

oh yeah...let me take this opportunity to say:

If you don't have a registered version of DOOM, get your ass in gear 
and give them a call.  The number I used here in Canada is 1-800-661-7383
and it cost me something like $64 for shipping and handling, taxes (Ontario)
, and the game (nice box and everything).  It took about 2 days to get from
Edmonton to Toronto!!...

IF ANY GAME IS WORTH BUYING IT'S DOOM!!! 

Anyways, try it out and let me know what you think....in the mean time,
another NEW level is under construction...

-Pete
