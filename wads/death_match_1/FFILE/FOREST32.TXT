Version Info            : Ver 3.2 was released for DOOM 1.9 support.
                          Ver 3.1 corrected a few bugs and has better
                          demos, with one multi-player!.
                          With ver 3.0, I added a preview level taken
                          from my upcomming OTTAWAU.WAD. It was E2M5
                          but now it's more approprietly E2M9, take a
                          look at it!

Description             : Forest is a five mission PWAD with new
                          graphics. Look at the sky and watch for
                          'graphiti' on some walls.
