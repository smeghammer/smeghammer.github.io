Misc. Author Info       : This Pwad is brought to you by the fine 
                          folks at Rat's Ass Software, a subsidary 
                          of Sosumi Enterprises.

Description: 

    As usual, I tried to cram 9 levels of action into one Pwad<G>.

    After its humiliating defeat at the hands of the lone Space Marine,
the evil Spider Boss has enslaved an outlying UAC base and is now attempting
to construct a new spider-vehicle out of an indestructible new alloy. A
previous mission failed when a Space Marine radioed in that he had found the
yellow keycard whose removal would stop the dreaded Forge of Doom, then
abruptly ceased transmissions. Your mission: Disable the Forge of Doom, 
destroy the evil minions of the Spider Boss, and get out alive. Deep-radar
scans report that the metal mines are extremely deep in the planet's crust,
so you may have to go through Hell itself to get out. 

    USSMC budget cuts necessitate that you will be armed only with your
personal Mark 1 Mod 0 pistol.

    Your initial transporter coordinates will place you in the area of the
least personnel activity, the civilian Art Museum. You must find your way
into the facility.

    [NOTE: This is a repost of FORGE.WAD, which contained some
     sound samples that may pe percieved as proprietary. This
     wad has no rip-off sounds or graphics, so now you can
     rip *me* off all you want. Go ahead, make some bucks.
     Just put my name in REAL BIG LETTERS. ]


Additional Credits to   : Kami (again), who plays DOOM with his feet,
                          thanks for the step-wall idea
                        : William (again), for all the Inet footwork that
                          makes this possible
                        : SPACKLE.LTD for unprintably evil ideas and
                          for saying "make it big"
                        : Yak Man, for spiritual guidance

Additional Notes:         Some of the pits in this level are out-and-out
                          traps, with no exit. You die. There are beasts
                          in there to facilitate your passage. The upshot
                          of this is that you cannot get 100% kills. Don't
                          sweat it. Also, be sure to die at least once so
                          you can enjoy the death sound patch. [Removed in
                          FORGEX.WAD.]

                          Some areas have very dense topology and animation  
                          and may be painfully slow on lesser machines.
