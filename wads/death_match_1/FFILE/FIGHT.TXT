Misc. Author Info       : 17 year old high school student way up
                          North in CANADA!!  Looking at going into
                          a systems analyst program.

Description             : After fighting your way through the
                          Shores of Hell (man were you ever Knee
                          Deep in the Dead at the time), you think 
                          back on the Inferno.  That was kinda cool
                          you think to yourself.  Oh well, nothing
                          left for me to do except go home and watch
                          T.V.  All of a sudden you hear the voice
                          of death itself!!!  "NOT SO FAST HUMAN!!"

                          You find yourself fighting for your life once
                          more.  Let's hope this is the final fight!!
