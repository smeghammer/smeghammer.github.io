Misc. Author Info       : Nothing of interest.  :)

Description             : Very big (over 550 sectors) deathmatch level with
                          many different areas including a large death arena,
                          a room with many disorienting elevators, some
                          strategically placed lighting, a couple of one-way
                          walls, etc.  I suggest playing on difficulties 1,
                          2, or 3 with "-respawn", or on difficulty 4 without
                          "-respawn", unless you are really cool. :)  
                          Since this level is so big, you might try hunting 
                          each other down in "cooperative" mode, so you can 
                          see where your "friend" is.  (I've played for over
                          a half an hour before without seeing my "friend") 
                          Also, you might want to look really hard, and you 
                          might find some secret areas that you might use to 
                          your advantage.  (Maybe even use an editor to find 
                          them) Well, enough of this, let's get to the 
                          important stuff.

FTP sites: 

        infant2.sphs.indiana.edu
        wuarchive.wustl.edu

This is my first pwad, (even though it took me a few weeks to complete) so 
please no flames.  E-mail me constructive criticism, compliments, or if you
just want to tell me that I'm really cool.  :)  I will be releasing my 
second level sometime in the next week or two.  It will be called something
like "Penta-frag".  It includes five elevators that move up and down, and 
depending on the height of the elevator, you may go in one eight different
directions.  (It isn't nearly as big)

Have fun, and DOOM on!
