Misc. Author Info       : Erwen Tang is a student at Thomas 
                          Jefferson High School for Science &
                          Technology.  Paul Robinson is a good
                          friend of mine who likes to play DOOM
                          and know a lot about the way wads work.

Technical Advisor       : Paul Robinson who figured out how to make
                          some things in the wad, added single player
                          and coop mode play, added an end-of-level
                          switch, a signature, figured how to get rid
                          of some HOMs, and removed three nasty moire
                          effects.

Description             : You start out in the middle of an arena,
                          if you are able to reach a teleporter, you
                          can enter the second area.  There is also a
                          special third area you can fight or run through.

                          What is different about this Wad that 300
                          others don't have?  Hint: look at the ceiling, :)
                          
                          1. No bottlenecks: every spot has at least two
                             exits; you can't be locked down.  You also
                             have to watch at least two places for
                             enemies.

                          2. Better weapons selection: if you select the
                             first two weapons levels, only shotgun,
                             chainsaw and pistol are available.  At level
                             3, chaingun is available and at level 4,
                             rocket launcher is available.  Why do this?
                             We found in playing deathmatch, that the game
                             became too easy with the plasma rifle or rocket
                             launcher all the time.  It also made the game's
                             outcome depend on whoever got to the biggest
                             weapon first.

                             Shotgun and Pistol can be evaded.  Plasma gun
                             makes getting killed too easy.  Rockets can                                               
                             kill just from the blast wave.  The reduction
                             in firepower makes the game more interesting
                             since even an inexperienced player can do 
                             killing damage to a seasoned veteran.

                             An inexperienced player is no match against
                             a more experienced one even with equal high-
                             powered weaponary.  This also makes the game
                             more fun since you never know what will happen.

* Construction *

Base                    : New level from scratch
Build Time              : 1 Month on & off

                          IS something that's worth a new version, 
                          PLEASE report it to me or my associate so we
                          can continue to develop a better product.
