			  All the Gamers+ DOOM junkies like myself.  Ideas 
			  are still pouring out.

Description             : Painless is my final level for DOOM.  It 
			  encompasses all the things I've collected about the 
			  DOOM engine into one level.  Although the level is 
			  large, it will save with no problems.  Deathmatch 
			  and Cooperative starts are available in the level, 
			  so feel free to frag your 
			  co-workers/friends/relatives/spouses/selves. 

Instructions            : Put PAINLESS.WAD and PAINLESS.BAT in your DOOM 
			  directory, then type "PAINLESS."  Skill level 
			  defaults at "Ultra-Violence".  Select "New Game" 
			  and "The Shores of Hell" and you're off.  Oh, and 
			  be ready to shoot... ;)

Disclaimer              : I assume no responsibility for anything of any sort
			  in any way, shape, or form, now, then, henceforeward, 
			  in this life (or the next several) for any screw-ups
			  or even minor inconveniences this PWAD causes you,
			  your family, your relatives, friends, ancestors,
			  associates, employers, pets, neighbors, lovers,
			  deities (major AND minor), nor any other person --
			  living, dead, or undead -- that you have or will 
			  ever have any contact with in even the slightest 
			  form.  This PWAD has been tested and tested ad 
			  infinitum, so it shouldn't mess with your computer 
			  or anything else remotely associated with it.  But 
			  if it DOES, then too damn bad.  Don't come cryin' 
			  to me.  It must be something YOU did. (C)opyright 
			  John Anderson.
