TO BEGIN, JUST ENTER "POW" FOLLOWING THIS TEXT.  

Following the brutal battles on Mars, Phobos, and Deimos, you
return to Home-Sweet-Earth only to discover that the UAC zombie-army
is bent on nothing short of the domination of the entire human race.
After months of fighting as part of a special-reaction force along 
with the rest of your space marine platoon, you find yourself engaged
in a desperate campaign against UAC forces in a hilly, swampy area
in the Southeastern U.S.  Surrounded along with your platoon, you
catch scrapnel from an exploding 55-gallon drum while dueling a Caco-
demon and pass out.

You awaken, startled by a loud noise and find yourself in a cage.
As you notice a UAC guard standing nearby, over the body of your best
friend, you realize that you are in the infamous underground Prisoner
of War stockade the UAC maintains beneath the swamp.  You silently check
your "back-up", the 9mm pistol you keep strapped to your calf.  Drawing
the handgun, you rise and take aim on the goon that just shot your buddy.

Noticing that no other guards are in the area, you take stock of the 
situation.  Your entire platoon lies horribly mangled in the various
cages, some showing signs of torture.  You know you have to get revenge.
You know that somehow you're going to put those mutants in their own cages,
where they will live to regret killing your buddies.  But not for long...
