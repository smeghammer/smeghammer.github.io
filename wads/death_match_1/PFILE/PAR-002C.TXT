Description             : Most deathmatch PWADs I've seen are
                          pretty pathetic. They usually consist
                          of a lame arena type of set up with
                          weapons/ammo wall-to-wall.

                          Well, not in Tombstone. I've recreated
                          (sort of) four square blocks of that
                          infamous western town.

                          No, you aren't Wyatt Earp, or even
                          one of his brothers. You are just a
                          guy who likes to frag his friends.
                          And TombStone DeathMatch makes it
                          fun!


Tactics                 : Yes, there are some tactics to this
                          PWAD:

                          - Get on the roof-tops to sniper
                            your pals!

                          - Open the stall doors in the barn
                            to release some nasties for your
                            opponents. Just make sure you
                            get out of the way.

                          - Do NOT hole yourself up inside
                            the storage area. You'll be an
                            easy target with the open walls
                            on each side.

                          - You're a panzy? Make a run for
                            the easy-access exit in the
                            northwest corner. Watch out for
                            sniper fire while you try it!

                          - Go for at least one heavy weapon
                            early in the match. FAST.
