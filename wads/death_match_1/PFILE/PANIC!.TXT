Title                   :PANIC!.WAD
Author                  :Jason Hargreaves (A really really bored Chem E student)
Email Address           :jhargrea@gpu.srv.ualberta.ca (only till September)

Description             :Well, here it is...
			This is an improved version of a level which I made
			The first version had some bugs and this is way better!
			A lot of blood sweat and tears went into this level
			(especially since I did it during final exams)

			I like my levels HARD!  There are many nasty bits in
			this level, ie. watch your ass and save often.
			Since it is the second level of the episode, I expect
			that people will come into the level with some ammo 
			and weapons (you may find it hard to warp straight into
			(I don't)).  If you play this level and like it, let me
			know by E-mail

			ENOUGH BLABBING!!  Play the frigging level!!

Additional Credits to   Mike Barker: Thanks for the txt format, liked your level
			Diane Boot: Sorry I was glued to my computer all day hon.
			Brendon Wyber and Rapha‰l Quinet: DEU v5 Rules!
			Mike Reed:  BSP sure fixes all those anoying bugs
			Mike Daskalopoulos:  My ever faithful beta-tester!!
				 (Too bad he's an EE)
