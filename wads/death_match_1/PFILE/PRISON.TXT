PRISON GUARD TOWER TRACKER V1.5  [GA]

Thank you for trying out Prison Guard Tower Tracker! by Albert C. Ashton

Prison Guard Tower Tracker offers continuous multimedia wave sound effects
playing in the background, even when you use your mouse tool. In this case
your mouse will turn into a infrared nightscope or spotlight. When you
click on the mouse button trigger, your mouse will turn into the your
hand/finger when you catch the prisoner.

This game is also larger, using the entire screen on standard VGA at
640x480. Previous games were smaller in size, but still fun to play.

We are now rating our games just like they do on the home video game
market .

GA    = GENERAL AUDIENCES  (Appropriated for all audiences)
MA-13 = MATURE AUDIENCES   (Parental Discretion Advised)

These are the two ratings I'll be using in my upcoming games titles.

PRISON GUARD TOWER TRACKER is rated at GA

I hope you enjoy playing this new format, and there will be more brand
new titles in the works for future releases within the year.  You may have
already downloaded or been trying out the new Thy Dragon v1.0
(THYDRG10.ZIP), and now you have the Prison Guard Tower Tracker
which is the 4th member of the Tracker Arcade Series to be released.
Of course more games will be out by the time you read this letter in
the months ahead. Like the all new Baby Brats - Super Play Room v3.0
(BBBRAT30.ZIP) which is also using this new format.
