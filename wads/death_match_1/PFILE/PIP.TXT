Description
-----------
Roughly octangonal arena dived into four by raised walkway. Designed for
Deathmatch 2 rules really (not much in the way of extra ammo or health).
There is an exit for those who moan about not having one. Each quadrant is
a little different. Some nice ledges around the edge for those who can work
out how to get the rocket launcher. Some invisible walls for trigger-happy
rocketeers to blow themselves up with. These have items on the top too
(gettable) for that `shit there's some health floating in the air' type
experience.
