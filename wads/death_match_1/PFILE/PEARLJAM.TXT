Description             : It's no secret, DOOMSDAY is a month away <BFG>
                          The Final level for 1.2 from this author,
                          Once again no fancy story line just a lot of
                          traps and secrets and some REALLY hard bits. :-)
                          BTW If it seems really impossible, look around
                          there IS a way.

                          If you wonder about the names it's just the name 
                          of the group that's on when I finally finish
                          creating a level <g>, if you haven't already, get
                          my other level - Nirvana.wad
