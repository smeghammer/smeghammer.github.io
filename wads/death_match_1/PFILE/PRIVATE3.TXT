Title                   : Private Hell, Part III

Description             : You made it through the spider demon in Part I. You
made it through the infestation of CacoDemons in Part II. Now, enter Baron 
Hell. This is the level your mother warned ya 'bout. You regain consciousness. 
Darklord appears before you yet again, laughing with a cackle that sends 
a shiver down your spine. Two down, 7 to go. Hahahahaha!!!!!!
"Piss off!" you growl and head for the nearest door. The dimness of the room
you are in echo's the dimness in your heart. Death is before you. Them or you.

Note: If you have not played Private Hell Part 1 & 2 don't worry. I have
revamped Part I, and have yet to release Part II on compuserve.(Too big) 
I am currently working quite diligently on an entire Private Hell series 
that should be ready for upload by September 15. This will encompass the 
entire Episode 1 and maybe if yer nice, the secret level too. Make sure ya 
got a BFG if ya wanna go through that. <G>

Enjoy and I will be floating along on the boards. C-ya!
