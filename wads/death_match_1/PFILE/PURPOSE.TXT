PWAD Version Info       : This is it! With the release of DOOM 2 I don't
			  have any plans to create additional DOOM 1 pwads.
			  This was mainly a self-teaching tool for myself to
			  learn how to create and manipulate pwads. I *am*
			  working on DOOM 2 pwad missions tho. I just love the
			  new textures, linedef triggers and more of DOOM 2.

Description             : This is an E2M1 level that could just as easily
			  be an E1M1 version but to keep it out of shareware
			  hands I made it an E2. (really guys, you should go
			  ahead and register. You won't be disappointed.)
			  The idea here wasn't to create a huge level but
			  instead this is to be used as a launching point for
			  additional levels/missions. The puzzles are
			  basic and the shootouts (IMHO) are fun rather than
			  always being cut-throat.

Additional Credits to   : Thanks to ID Software for the best game in a decade!
			  Thanks to Ben Morris for DCK. This is a VERY slick
			  editor that makes creations of PWADS almost as easy
			  as blowing away former humans. :-)
			  Thanks to Wirta Wiriyan for the MUS2PWAD.
			  Thanks to Patrick Green for the nifty sound batch
			  files for extracting and inserting sounds in pwads.
			  Credit also needs to be given to a slew of people
			  whos pwads I "borrowed" some of the sounds from. I
			  didn't keep track of all of the snippets but if you
			  hear your sound...thank you.

How to use this PWAD    : A batch file is included for ease of play. Simply
			  type PURPOSE and it will load the necessary files
			  for you. Or if you prefer, you can use something
			  like DOOMlaunch to load the following wads;

			  PURPOSE.WAD	-	Main level wad
			  PURP_MUS.WAD	-	Music wad
			  PURP_SND.WAD	-	Sound effects wad
			  
			  Create a subdirectory off of your DOOM directory
			  called PURPOSE. Place all of the files from the
			  ZIP file into the PURPOSE subdirectory. Copy the
			  PURPOSE.BAT file to your DOOM directory and you're
			  on your way.

* Copyright / Permissions *

Authors may ABSOLUTLY use this level as a base to build additional
levels.  It would be considered polite to make mention that you did
use this.

* caveat *

Just an observation on my part but imagine if you will that instead of
the current open structure of DOOM, you had to purchase additional levels
instead. Not as much fun as what we currently have eh? In that light I hope
that additional authors will keep an "open" attitude in regards to others
"using" their pwads. I understand that we don't want 50 different versions
of FOREST.WAD running around but at the same time imagine someone using that
structure in a unique way. Maybe not always original but modifying it to
meet other users wants and desires. The jist of this is only that we all
got our ideas from what ID did and expanded or modified on that. Shall we as
"addon" authors be so uptight as to not allow others the same freedom?

* end of caveat *

You MAY distribute this WAD, provided you include this file, with
no modifications.  You may distribute this file in any electronic
format (BBS, Diskette, CD, etc) as long as you include this file 
intact.

The story, mission, plot, etc...

	"What the hell....?", I raised myself up slowly and tried to shake the
cobwebs out of my head. The Ace of Clubs. That's the last thing I remember
where I was at. Pablo and I had gone there for a few drinks. A few drinks
turned into a BUNCH of drinks. Pablo and I had been discussing the tactics
used in the Mars mission and swapping untold amounts of hair raising stories
of bravado. I remember there was one person at the bar that seemed to flinch
noticably at times while we carried on. Near the end of the night he (it?)
got up and left leaving a small note on the counter. I reached over and
grabbed it in the thought of letting the mysterious personage know that he
had forgotten it by mistake but when I turned around he had already
disappeared. Not thinking much of it I stuffed the note into my shirt
pocket and continued to listen to Pablo describe a particular nasty event
involving a shotgun and numerous pink demons. In the middle of the story
Pablo went under and fell off the stool drunkenly in a heap. I was laughing so
hard that I too began to sway in my seat and followed suit with Pablo.

	I was face down on a very hard floor and noticed that I had
obviously spent most of the night (day?) sleeping in my vomit. Pushing myself
up in a push-up position I happened to notice that the note I had found last
night was now directly underneath me. I eased myself down slowly and reached
for the note. I read the first line.

			LOOK IN FRONT OF YOU!

	I felt my stomach begin to churn as I now knew where Pablo was. He
had been placed on a stake that had been thrust into his back and left for
the vultures enjoyment. "BASTARDS!", I screamed. I was frozen viewing the
mangled body that was once my best friend. I could see that he was still
barely alive and twitching but only for a few more seconds. The blood of the
pool behind him was almost completly full. I remembered the note and began to
continue to read the rest of the note with trembling hands of rage.

			YOUR FRIEND IS EITHER DEAD OR
			ALMOST DEAD. THERE IS NO HOPE
			IN SAVING HIM. MY NAME IS
			ZISCRAL AND I HAVE THE ABILITY
			TO VIEW THE FUTURE. I SAW IN
			THE BAR A VISION OF YOU AND
			HIM AND SAW THE OUTCOME THAT
			YOU NOW ARE SEEING. I SAW
			ALSO YOU AVENGING HIS DEATH BUT
			ONLY IF YOU HAD THE SKILL TO DO
			SO. YOU HAVE BEEN KIDNAPPED TO
			THE BARON KARAN'S LABRATORY. THE
			BARON IS CURRENTLY BUSY IN HIS
			DEEPEST ROOM WORKING ON THE
			DEVICES THAT WILL KIDNAP MORE OF
			YOUR MARS SQUAD TO HIS LABRATORY
			FOR TORTURE. YOU MUST KILL ALL OF
			THE BARON'S COMRADES AND THEN KILL
			THE BARON HIMSELF. I WISH YOU LUCK.
			THE ONLY HELP I CAN GIVE YOU IS THE
			FACT THAT HELP IS AVAILABLE FOR
			EASIER KILLING OF THE BARON VIA HIS
			CHAIR.

	The note ended abruptly at that point. Suddenly the cobwebs were
gone and I rose quickly and spun around expecting the worse. In front of me
were floating computers. These were obviously the devices that were used to
transport myself and Pablo here. I'm sure that they were here to impress me
with the technology that was used to create them but I was busy with more
important matters to take much notice. Especially the need for more firepower.
"Ah-HA!", I exclaimed when I spotted my trusty shotgun. Running over I grabbed
the cold steel and gave a reassuring recock of the gun to be positive that the
gun ws still loaded. It was but I would need more ammo.

	Surveying the surroundings I noticed a wooden door to the north.
I opened it and realized this must be the main control area for those floating
computer crates outside. I was amazed at the technology showing on the monitors
displaying coordinates on not only Earth but other planets as well. I heard
a familiar grunt behind me and grinned as I knew exactly what that sound was.
Whirring around I unloosed a barrel into a nearby imp. While cocking my gun
I was blindsided by a fireball to my side. "Come on you bastard!", I yelled
as I spun on the imp unloading as I did. Realizing that I was in the midst of
danger and no time for sightseeing I grabbed what I could out of the room
and headed back out to the main courtyard. I noticed stairs to the east and
was just about to head up when I saw a small amount of blood seeping from
a wall to my north. "Hmmmm.", I said, "This doesn't seem right." I gave a push
to the wall and a secret room appeared with a glowing blue skull inside.
Grabbing it I headed back into the courtyard and up the stairs.

	Pitch black greeted me as I cautiously made my way up. In the distance
I noticed something strange. An exit sign! So near to the start this was my
way out! Just before I began to sprint to the exit I looked back at the
distant corpse of my friend Pablo. No. There would be NO exit until I had
finished ridding this foul cesspool of all inhabitants. I reshouldered my
shotgun and continued my slow walk up the now blackened stair case.

To be continued...........by YOU!
