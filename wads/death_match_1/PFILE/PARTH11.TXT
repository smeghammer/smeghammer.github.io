Description             : Parthenon was originally a beautiful rendition
                          of the structure of the same name in Greece,
                          but HoM considerations reduced it to the
                          vestige you see in the exact middle of the
                          map. (For those interested, the original still
                          exists, and if I ever find a way to use it, it
                          will appear in it's entirety.)

                          What was hoped to be a challenging pwad for
                          deathmatches grew into this sprawling series
                          of hallways around a large courtyard with a
                          few challenging outer rooms.

                          I'm still learning, so constructive criticism
                          is appreciated.

                          BTW, as the editors continue to increase in
                          utility, one has to look at wads completed
                          when the editors were much more crude with a
                          degree of wonder. Look at Megawatt, or one of
                          the other 1993 wads and be amazed.
