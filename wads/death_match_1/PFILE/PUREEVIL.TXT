The story...
Once it was that our fair lands lived in peace. Suffering and misery was
known not to our virtuous people. Then upon one mid summer morn there
arose a great sound and violent shaking of the earth, so terrible that
the land itself was broken asunder. From out of the resulting chasm
ascended the fury of hell itself intending only to conquer and enslave.
Thus it was that evil hath cometh to invade our beloved sanctuary. 
I pray thee go ye at the quick to the locality where it now doth live. 
Once there thou art instructed to dispatch with thine enemies until they 
no longer breath or moveth upon these great lands and our people may 
thus once again enjoy the serenity that is our home. P.S. Thou needst not 
actually destroy thine most powerful enemies observethed near the end
of the level. Thou mightst find another method to vanquish him.
