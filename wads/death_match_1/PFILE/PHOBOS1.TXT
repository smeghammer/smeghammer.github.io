                         "DOOM TOURNAMENT WAD PACK"

        These WAD files were used for the first DOOM tournament in
      the ARK-LA-TEX erea held on 27th of Aug 1994 in Bossier city La.
      This pack consists of six WAD files, the files named PHOBOS 1-5
      were used for game play and TIE.WAD was used for any ties. All of
      the PHOBOS files are basicly the same with monsters and wepons moved
      around, TIE.WAD is a small room with only shotguns.
       We used a double elimination format so that every one got to play
      at least twice. There were two PCs hooked together via null modem
      useing DOOMMASTER to help speed up the loading of the WADs. The
      contributrs were (in no certian order) SMUG BBS, FASTTRACK BBS.
      X-TRONIC BBS, WAL-MART, BABBAGES SOFTWARE, AND ME AND TED WHITE
      (out of our own pocket).
