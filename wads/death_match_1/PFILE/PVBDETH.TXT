    Author's Comments:

    This .wad was the original beta-test project for the **Doom Construction
Kit** and involved many hours of design and bug-fixing for that program. IT
RULEZ ! READ THE DOCS ALREADY.. and trust me you will like it better than
*anything* else.  It's not as versatile as DEU but it is *way* better for
actual dungeon designing.

    Originally a coop wad, this .wad is great for serious buttchomping in the
hands of any but an expert !  Beware of the node(?) problem in the first room,
and do your best to compensate for the Hall of Mirrors in the stairway room
until the newer versions of doom arrive.  (Just swivel around a bit to clear
the effect). You will need to have some patience with this .wad unless in coop
mode, and i dont recommend it for deathmatches. It's generally a good idea to
go where you are led, but not always right away.  Watch for concealed switches
and secret areas that make the level much easier.

    Enjoy the "cage match" with a baron, and relax because there are NO
CYBERDEMONS or SPIDERDEMONS.  Use cover and let the crossfires do some of the
work.  There is enuff ammo here for all but the worst rookiez !!!

    Thanks to id and everyone who tries and buys DCK cuz it is THE ONE ! :)
