Description             : You have died. Your mission was a failure and
you took a round to the head.  Darkness fades and suddenly light is restored.
You focus your eyes. You are in a a stone room. A chainsaw lies nearby and
a box of rounds. Suddenly a face appears, shimmering phantomlike before you.
"Nice to see you awake" the being says. "I am the DarkLord, Master of death, 
and you are my newest acquisition." He continues, "I will give you one chance. 
Find the exit and I while will restore you to your former life."
        "Fail and......HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!................."
The face disappears and you assess the situation. You pick up the bullets,
hoist the chainsaw to your back, and walk through the door...........
