This is an edited level of Episode 2 Map 1 with the walls completely re-done 
with wood texture.  There's not much else changed with the exception of a few  
monster changes, and the ability to jump into the main hall. (not sure of the 
exact name, but you'll get the picture when you get there).  There's not a
big difference but there's a lot of graphic changes and I think it looks
like nicer. :)
       If you have any questions, comments or suggestions send them to me
at chopkins@bud.peinet.pe.ca or look for me on irc channel #doom as Lithium.  
Let me know if you think it's any good and I'll try making a new level!
Thanks!
