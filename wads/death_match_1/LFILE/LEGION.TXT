Description             : Your mission is to secure a strange bunker in the
                          Australian outback where many comrads have vanished.
                          You parachute in to a small court yard and 
                          immediately realize the only way out is DOWN! Two 
                          mysterious stairways disappear into the stench 
                          filled ground. You don't feel so hot... yet!                            

                          This wad was made for a single player but I played 
                          it with another via modem and it worked fine. Was 
                          lots of fun! Also it has its own original music, 
                          written and performed by my brother John, which is 
                          GREAT!(Yes- this is an objective opinion.)<grin>
