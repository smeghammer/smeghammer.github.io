Description             : This Wad was made to challange the Doom player in 
		          skill aspects along with Killings (of course).
 		          Warning! Not everything is what it appears to be.  Get that 
			  (you'll see what I mean).  The level can be 
			  completed without cheats, a little thought and 
			  effort is all that is needed. Get the Rocket
			  launcher when you see it, you'll need it.

			  Oh yeah, and my wife who put up with my long hours
			  of staring at the computer screen.
