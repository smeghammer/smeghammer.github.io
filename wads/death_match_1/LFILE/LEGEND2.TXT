Description:

This is the second in a series of new wads.  This is a completely new
level and is not based on any previous level (from ID or elsewhere).

This level is a bigger then level 1 and uses nicer effects.  Note the
neat three part door near the end.  

Again, this level support different levels of difficulty and I have
played it at all levels (except multi-player).  It support all four
players in coop or deathmatch modes.  Unlike level 1 (which is NOT
a good deathmatch level but is ok for solo or coop play) level 2 does
make a good deathmatch level (for those of you who want them) as well
as solo and coop.

Comments are always welcome!

Look for level three in 1 - 2 weeks.
