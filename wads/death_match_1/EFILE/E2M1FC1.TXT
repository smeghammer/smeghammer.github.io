Title                   : Secrets...

Misc. Author Info       : Doom fanatic, just getting into building.

Description             : It's dangerous out there... Four areas of a large
                          base, each with it's own special 'feel'.  Some
                          monsters are to be destroyed, others might best
                          be avoided. (The Cyber-Demon Lord comes to 
                          mind... ;)  This is a difficult level, especially
                          the first time through. It IS possible to beat
                          it though. All weapons are provided, here and
                          there, and there is plenty of ammo lying around.
                          You don't HAVE to find all the keys as there are
                          secret (and not so secret, if you can get past
                          the cyber lord) doors that will let you get from
                          section to section without going through the
                          'key' doors. There are lots of secret rooms and
                          many of the doors are not obvious. Nose around.
                          Play time averages around 20 minutes for me. 
                          (If you know where the secret's are and don't
                          bother to hunt for 'things' or kill stuff you
                          can get from start to finish in three minutes)
                          Probably be closer to 40+ for someone who 
                          doesn't know the way around. (You should 
                          especially enjoy the 'maze'... I still get lost
                          in there and I BUILT the damned thing!:)

* Construction *

Base                    : New level from scratch

Editor(s) used          : DoomCAD (Tried resaving it with DEU to see if
                          that would resolve the 'bugs' listed below but
                          got an unusable mess. I'll try again after 
                          I've figured out DEU.)

Known Bugs              : Some walls appear transparent when viewed at
                          a certain angle.  If anyone knows what I did 
                          wrong PLEASE drop me some email. It's driving 
                          me batty!

*****************************************************************
NOTE:
There are two BMP files included with this level.  The file
E2M1FC1.BMP shows what you would see if you had the computer map
power-up.  There are two secret doors + accompanying rooms that 
DO NOT show on the computer map.  The file SECRETS.BMP shows
these rooms. Therefore, if you want to find all the secrets on
your own, don't look at secrets.bmp.
