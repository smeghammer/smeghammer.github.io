E1L1KP.WAD is a brand new level for all you doom addicts
who are tired of looking at the same old ones, or seeing the same
maps with only different objects, wall textures, etc.

It can be used in both normal play mode an in DEATHMATCH mode.

It's a 'small' level - about 100 vertexes, and a similar number of
linedefs, but only 9 sectors.  It isn't very complicated,
but it should be fun to play, and it provides a good example
of what can be created using deu5.0

to use:
        doom -devparm -file e1l1kp.wad -wart 1 1
which will teleport you right to the new level, or use
        doom -file e1l1kp.wad
and enter 'Knee Deep in the Dead' normally.

BTW - you need the registered version of DOOM to run this,
unless your shareware version is able to show an energy cell. :-) 

E1L1KP.WAD was created with DEU5.0 and DEU4.3 
by Karl R. Peters on 4/1/94.

- DOOM editor notes -

DEU 4.3 was used to edit the errors that DEU 5.0 causes
when it creates nodes.  When DEU 5.0 creates nodes, it inserts
additional vertexes along a linedef.  However, it does not break
the linedef up into several linedefs.  As a result, it will often
allow a linedef to cross the boundary of a node - a big no-no,
apparently.

To correct this, you must use deu4.3 with the '-debug' parameter
to delete the faulty linedefs and insert new ones.  (The vertexes
created by DEU 5.0 are not visible or usable in DEU5.0 edit mode nor
DEU 4.3 normal edit mode, but are visible in DEU 4.3 debug mode.)

I hope this helps everyone who has been frustrated by DEU 5.0 - 
hopefully a 5.1 will come out soon.
