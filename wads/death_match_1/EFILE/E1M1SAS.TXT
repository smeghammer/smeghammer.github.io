* The story *

After months of battling the evil spawn of hell, you have
finally fallen in the heat of battle. As you fade to black, you
realize that the final blow has not come, instead you are being
lifted and carried away... to a dark empty cell, where you are
to be imprisoned for eternity! Weeks pass... the cell walls are
closing in. The only other sign of life is the guard, who taunts
you relentlessly, day after day. This day, as the guard
(laughing wickedly) tosses foul, bloody meat scraps at you, you
decide that you can take it no longer. Completely surprising the
guard, you lunge at the cell bars, reaching through to wrap your
hands around his neck and strangle the life from him. As his
body slumps to the ground, you happily claim his pistol and the
few ammo clips that he has, after all, he won't be needing them!
But you find no key that will open the cell! You're trapped!
Will the guard be missed? What will you do?

================================================================
* Description *

This is the very first completely original DOOM level that I
made. E2M1SAS was just a modification to the original E2M1. This
level is fairly large and has lots interesting architecture.
There are a few secret areas, one of which will give you access
to the blue key. The others will supply you with additional
weapons and ammo. All of the skill settings are enabled. though
Ultra Violence on this level can get a bit hairy at times, it is
certainly not impossible.

================================================================
* How To Play *

To load E1M1SAS into DOOM, copy E1M1SAS.WAD to your DOOM
directory and enter:

   doom -file E1M1SAS.WAD

To play it over the modem or on a network, consult the game docs
and the FAQ. If you still need help, e-mail me.
