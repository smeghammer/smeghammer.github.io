Description     :  I called it Eye Spy because, well, it seemed appropriate.
                   This level may seem large at the onset, but it has
                   been found to be "just right" when playing in deathmatch.
                   There are many, many sniper zones; a large catwalk sur-
                   rounding a large courtyard; an altar room with a pit of 
                   death :) ; a torture room with a crushing ceiling; a 
                   lockable room for those occasions where you need to 
                   "duck in quick"; a look-out tower; a upward spiral 
                   staircase; ALOT of barrels; and ALL the weapons.. 
                   (if you can find 'em...); and a bunch of secret rooms.

Note             : Have fun.
