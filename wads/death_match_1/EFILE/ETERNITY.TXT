Title                   : SERENITY II aka ETERNITY (v1.1)
                          A full replacement for the second episode of
                          Doom (which means there are 8 levels - sorry,
                          no bonus level in this one, but you won't miss
                          it...).
                          In the months after the release of SERENITY, we
                          have been working hard to come up with a
                          worthy successor for it. ETERNITY has the same
                          look & feel as SERENITY has. In ETERNITY you
                          won't have to puzzle as much, but for that
                          more time has been put in the design of the
                          levels.  We also think that ETERNITY is slighty
                          harder to play than SERENITY, but it is still
                          doable to play it at "Hurt me plenty" without
                          cheating.
IMPORTANT               : Do NOT move this level to another episode,
                          since you can't finish the last level (8) if it
                          isn't played as E2M8!
                          IF YOU USE DOOM 1.2 OR LOWER, RUN ETERNITY WITH
                          THE ETERWITH.BAT. IF YOU USE 1.666, USE THE
                          ETERNONE.BAT WHICH DOESN'T INCLUDE MUSIC!

Misc. Author Info       : Two guys with too much spare time...

Description             : This set of 8 levels has been made with the
                          word quality in mind. It's Mind here, not
                          Muscles! We have tried to find a good mixture
                          of action, architecture and adrenaline.
                          Some of the levels may be a breeze, others may
                          be a real pain in the *ss. But remember one
                          thing: YOU DON'T HAVE TO USE THE CHEATS!!!
                          There are a few very though places, but they
                          can be done. When it seems you can't get
                          around them without using the cheats, you may
                          be doing it the wrong way and/or you may have
                          missed one or more (valuable!) hidden rooms
                          (which contain power-ups, weapons and/or ammo).
                          Hidden rooms, as said before, can always be
                          recognized in some way (different texture,
                          different light-level, etc.).

Additional Credits to   : DEU (5.2GCC and 5.21), BSP (1.2x) and their
                          many contributors; Id (no comment); all those
                          people who have been so kind to send us
                          remarks and feed-back about our previous
                          wad-files (NATHRATH and SERENITY); every
                          WADmaker whose WAD has been a source of
                          inspiration for the rooms in ETERNITY;
                          all those people who have given feed-back on
                          ETERNITY already.

                          And all those many others we have forgotten.

* Descriptions *

Level 1 Description     : "From Here Till Eternity"
                          Enter Eternity. Enter the unholy church.

                          A very large level with awesome use of marble

                          the people who 'work' here do not seem to be
                          paying much attention to their job. They'll
                          pay that to you!

                          The name says it all! A level with lots of

                          This level is a farewell to Eternity, but also
                          a hello to Serenity. But first some work has
                          to be done...


* Construction *

Base                    : 8 new levels from scratch.
Construction Time       : One month.

Editor(s) used          : DEU 5.21 and 5.22GCC, plus BSP 1.2x and IDBSP.

Known Bugs              : There are a few small HOMs at the beginning of
                          level 1 if you play it with Doom 1.2 or 1.1.
                          The HOMs won't handicap you very much as they
                          never appear in places very close to you.

                          There is a sort of elevator/bridge combo in
                          level 2 of which we aren't a 100% sure that it
                          works error-free. That is: there is a very
                          chance that you will encounter something
                          strange there if you go back (which you don't
                          have to...). A few players have mailed us
                          about this. It seems that the behaviour is
                          very unpredictable, and it even varies from
                          version to version (Doom 1.666 handles this
                          differently than other versions).


* Philosophy *

Appearance/Design       : A lot of effort was put into making things look
                          good. We are especially pleased with the
                          several light effects, and the continuity of
                          the used textures.
                          Not everything in this episode has a purpose.
                          Some things are just there for artistic or
                          architectural purposes. We think that is one of
                          the aspects that made the original DOOM levels
                          so good.

Traps                   : All levels have been designed in a way that
                          they do not contain places where you can get
                          trapped (at least not without providing you
                          with some kind of 'emergency exit').
                          Yet, should there be a place where you do get
                          stuck, and cannot get out except by using
                          'IDSPISPOPD', then let us know!

Secret Areas            : You do not have to get into the secret areas
                          to complete a level. Keys or switches to open
                          doors or areas are never located in secret areas.

                          All secret areas/doors are marked in some way
                          (for instance by giving it another light
                          level, or a slightly different texture).

Monsters                : We prefer quality over quantity, but on the
                          other hand we also want a WAD that offers lots
                          of action. We have tried to find a good balance
                          between quality and quantity.
                          We did make an exception though for
                          "Ultraviolence". Here there are an awfully lot
                          of monsters, and it should give those who like a
                          lot of fragging & fighting the challenge and
                          action you want (so we hope...).

We will also upload it to wuarchive and a few other sites as soon as
possible.


* Other Releases *

Besides this WAD, we have another complete episode to play. It is, as
you might have guessed, SERENITY (I). It is a full replacement of Doom's
third episode. If you like SERENITY II, you will most definitely like
SERENITY (I).
We have also release a sound-WAD with the complete collection of our
favourite Doom sounds. You should be able to get SERSOUND.WAD at the
same place/site as where you got this file (the same goes for SERENITY).

Enjoy!
