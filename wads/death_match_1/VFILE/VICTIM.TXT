Description             : One of the deatchmatch competitors has to
                          enter a bunker-like stronghold by using the
                          teleporter in the north of the starting-room.
                          Once used this teleporter is sealed. The other
                          ones are his victims, and THERE ARE ways to kill
                          the bunker dude.
                          Inside the bunker are six rooms, connected by
                          teleporters. The main platform in the middle of
                          the area is the main lookout and connection to
                          four sniper positions. This looks like that:

                                       x



                                    x  O  x

                                       x

                          where x is one of the sniper positions and the
                          'O' is the main platform. Remember: By using the 
                          teleports quickly, you are able to travel from 
                          south to north faster than a rocket. The fifth 
                          teleporter in the 'O' (which walls are only 
                          transparent from the inside, but can be shoot 
                          from outside) is the connection to the control 
                          room. Here you are safe (Ok, I build in a trap 
                          to keep my friend from entering it), you have all
                          weapons and ammo. Important: There are six buttons 
                          in this room. More important: Press only one of 
                          them until the victims have handeled it (One button 
                          rises the bottom of one of the six holes in the 
                          area. PRESS ONLY ONE OF THEM, because if there are 
                          a lot of cybers outside, you have two problems: 
                          1) THEY kill your victims, what means you don't get 
                          many frags. 2) If there are more that 2 of those 
                          guys outside, it's hard to know where they are and
                          then maybe a rocket (or ten or more) passes trough 
                          the small windows of the sniper positions and 
                          that's it. (The main platform is too dangerous with 
                          cybers out there, because THEY can (unlike your 
                          victims) see you (and kill you) through the walls.

                          (No one will be able to reenter it).
