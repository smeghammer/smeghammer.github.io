Vortex.wad
Replaces e2m1-e2m3

Welp, this is my first attempt at creating
a wad file for DOOM. As I tinker with the different
editors and utilities, I feel I am progressivly getting
better at this (You'll notice a big difference in overall level
quality and coherency between e2m1 and e2m3). I hope you enjoy
these floors and I welcome feedback, complaints and bug reports.

Now for my shameless plug:
Making Doom levels takes one hell of a long time. These three 
floors are the fruits of a month's hard labors and frustrations.
I'd like to make more, but being a full time student with a full 
time job, time is short. If people out there don't like my level 
style, then I'm wasting my time making these things, so if you like 
my stuff and want more, I am asking a $5.00 donation :) Your donation 
will sorta be like a vote for me to make more. 

For the $5.00 donation, I'll send you another 3 levels when they 
are completed. Just include your name, address and what things you'd 
like to see in future levels (I'm always open to good, original 
suggestions). And if you really can't afford the money, then just 
drop me a line about what you think.

Thanx and happy Dooming!
