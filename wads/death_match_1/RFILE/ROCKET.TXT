Summary:

Play this level if you find DOOM a little hard. It is guaranteed to make 
you feel really good inside. 

You've just come across The Annual Convention of the Former Human and 
Seargent Appreciation Society. There are several parties going on and
you can see that the crowd has formed into several mingling groups. What's
this? A BFG 9000 AND a Rocket Launcher? Wow, today's my lucky day...

- Michael.

(BTW: To enhance the experience, play either "It's a Wonderful World" 
 by Louis Armstrong or "The Thieving Magpie" by Gioacchino Rossini)
