Hello... you are now the proud owner of URBAN.WAD by C. Bradford Rose
(cbr@wpi.edu).

Included in this zipfile are-

URBAN.WAD         Urban Nightmare for DOOM
URBAN.TXT         Text file
DEHACKED.EXE      DOOM.EXE hacker
DEHACKED.INI
FLAME.DEH         Dehacked patch for two new weapons
README.TXT        This file
FLAME.BAT         Install file for the weapons patch

To install the weapons patch simply put these files in your DOOM directory
and edit DEHACKED.INI to fit your needs. Then run FLAME.BAT... that's it!

This will not modify your DOOM.EXE file (if you do this right). It will copy
it and modify the copied .exe file.

After this is done... you should have flame.exe (the new .exe file with the
new weapons). To play multi-player with these weapons make sure all players
have and run this .exe file.

New weapons...


Flamethrower (formally the rocket launcher)- spews out flames.. a very deadly
        weapon, especially since the flames have an area effect :). Do not
        point this at a wall, use it at close range, or run foward while
        firing.

Plasma Cannon (formally the Plasma rifle)- A plasma rifle with a MUCH slower
        rate of fire, and a MUCH stronger punch.
