Misc. Author Info       : First try at computer graphic design work.
                          I write business programs and software for 
                          midrange HAL computers and thought this would
                          be a challenge (It definitely was!!). 

Description             : My goal was to produce a PWAD that took some 
                          thought and/or skill to play rather that pure 
                          blast 'em 3rd grade logic.

                          All secrets and doors are marked in some way
                          by change in color, texture or decoration.
                          Pushing on walls to find totally hidden secrets
                          is not my idea of fun and a total waste of time.

                          Don't look for an over abundance of ammo as it
                          takes the skill out of the game.

Authors MAY include this level UNMODIFIED in multi-WAD distributions.

Authors may NOT modify, add and/or change or in any other way alter this 
level.  There are too many pretenders out there who feel if they 
add more weapons, ammo and enemies to an existing WAD they have created 
a masterpiece.  I have put too much time and effort to make this
WAD work like I have designed it to let some amateur who has never built
a single wall ruin my personal work of art.  (We artists are really
picky about these things aren't we.)

You MAY distribute this WAD, provided you include this file, with
no modifications.  You may distribute this file in any electronic
format (BBS, Diskette, CD, etc) as long as you include this file 
intact.

You MAY distribute this WAD file in any format.
