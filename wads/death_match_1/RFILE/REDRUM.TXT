Description             : Redrum is a rather large file, over 300k. For some
                          reason beyond my comprehension DOOM will not let
                          you save your game while playing Redrum.wad, so you
                          better be pretty good at doom! Also may I suggest
                          that you run doom with your "messages on". This is
                          the only way you will know if and what key you will
                          need to open a locked door for I have not color coded
                          them (I just didn't like the look of em' in my level)
                          I have included Deathmatch starts in this level but
                          I did not design the level for it. The level is so 
                          expansive you might never find each other.
                          I think there is a nice mix of monsters,amo,and 
                          first aid in the level. If you think it is too hard
                          or too easy you may add or delet amo and health to
                          suit your needs (I don't mind). I have also hidden
                          my secret doors very well, and you may have to use
                          more of a "Wolfenstein" approach to find them.
                          Have fun!
