Description             : My first WAD.  Designed for single player, multiple player or
			  Deathmatch modes, easy, medium or hard. Looks much like a
		          Castle, complete with moats, dungeons, secret passages, temples,
			  and even an open pit mine where they obviously got all of that
			  green marble (and there is a lot of green marble).

Additional Credits to   :  Richard Janis and Steve Coulber for creative input and testing.

This is my first WAD. Please let me know if you have any comments, suggestions
or constructive criticism. This is a very large level, and I do have one more
section which I would like to add, but it can grind at times, and there is a 
strange thing which happens in one room in particular, the temple (you'll know
it when you get there) in which you sometimes are blocked from moving forward
as if there was an invisible wall there, even though there is nothing. If anyone
knows how to fix this, or what it signifies please let me know. I'm always on the
lookout for good ideas to incorporate into another level, so if someone has some
thoughts about what they would like to see, but doesn't want to do it themselves
please let me know.
