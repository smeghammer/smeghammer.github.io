Description             : An arena-style, wide-open level.
                          A real challenge alone, easier in cooperative
                          mode, and an excellent deathmatch level.

Additional Credits to   : The wonderful DEUers who made DEU so I could
                          create this level. Those who don't, DEU!

Base                    : New level from scratch
Editor(s) used          : DEU 5.21 GCC
Known Bugs              : None...There used to be a Hall of Mirrors
                          in the center area, but setting DEU's
                          splitfactor to 16 fixed this. Users modifying
                          this level should use "-sf 16" on the command
                          line before using the Node Builder.

* Where to get this WAD *

I uploaded it to the GEnie network. If it's anywhere else,
don't blame me.  |+)

* Additional Comments / Hints *

With monsters: KEEP MOVING. Use the invulnerability spheres WISELY.
Don't enter the outer square until after you've dealt with everything
in the inner ones, and save the center room for last. Watch your ammo!

As Deathmatch: It's an arena with no cubbyholes or dead-ends, and all
the weapons are present except the BFG-9000. You also get to start with
a good weapon, ammo, and armor and can jump in when ready!

Multiplayer: In multiplayer mode (cooperative or deathmatch) at least
two people will have to work together to exit the level. (This means,
in a deathmatch, that no one person can spoil everyone else's fun by
throwing the exit switch - at least not without help.)
