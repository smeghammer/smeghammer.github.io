Description             : This WAD is a representation of the Uni
                          of Southern Queensland L and T block buildings.
                          Excellent deathmatch WAD. Weapons are fairly
                          low level (Shottie, pistol, chaisaw. 
			  This ensures maximum fairness and some cool
                          shoot outs and fisticuffs. Loads 'o sniper positions,
                          dark alleys, cool places to hide out. On 4 player
			  this WAD should kick ARSE! (I hope...testing it on the
			  weekend). Tested on 3 player. Groovalicious.
Additional Credits to   : Deadly Dave (he of the Moonspammers), Moory 
			  (also fellow Moonspammer and Pseudo-Echo piano guitarist
                          look-a-like) and anyone else I happen to destroy on this
			  wad. Also thanks to my playtesters: Georde, Matt, Deve
			  Caity, Mick, Jules, and everyone else.
			: Geoff Allan and ID software.
