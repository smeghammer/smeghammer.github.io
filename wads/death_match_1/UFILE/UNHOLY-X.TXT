Description             : Unholy Cross. An E1M1 deathmatch level designed
                          for  2-3  players. This PWAD is designed around
                          a tall central room  containing a massive fiery
                          alter. There are all the weapons except the BFG 
                          (it  ruins  DM) and  several  concealed  sniper 
                          points.  You  also  can  use  the slimy one-way 
                          sewer to your advantage.
