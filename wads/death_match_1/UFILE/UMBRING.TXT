Description           : Okay, this is the ultimate challenge for those
			Doom-Freaks crying for BLOOD!!!! This is my first
			level, beginning is good, but the longer you fight
			the better the challenge. It is designed for
			Ultra-Violence-Punks, so all whimps (remember -
			only whimps cheat) keep your fingers off, its too
			hard!!!!


Additional Credits    : Raphael Quinet and Brendon J Wyber for the DEU editor
			Colin Reed for the BSP utility
			and of course, those great people at id, without 
			which we would not have the pleasure to play DOOM.

Authors MAY NOT use this level as a base to build additional levels. 
Primarily because of the size of this level, it is at the limits of the Doom 
engine in an 8 Meg machine. I have spent a lot of time play balancing this 
level, so please enjoy it as is.

IF you like my wad, or don`t like it (for ??-reasons) , please let me know.
Iïm trying to build new levels, so please give me a feedback.
