Misc. Author Info       : Student at Worcester Polytech. Member of Army ROTC,
                          future infantry officer (gee, wonder why I like 
                          DOOM :) ). Plays computer games way to much.

Description             : The Apocalyspe has finally come to pass... all of 
                          Earth lies in ruin after a world-wide nuclear war.
                          You are a lone infantry soldier who has managed
                          to survive. You were lucky (depends on how you look
                          at it) to be in an underground bunker when a nuke
                          hit near your location. After the radiation levels
                          dropped off, you left to search for more supplies.
                          After many days of wandering.... you have come to 
                          realize the awful truth... the Earth as you knew it
                          is no more. You can find no signs of civilization 
                          or life... except of course if you count the
                          undead. The spawn of hell now roam the Earth...
                          You never really believed so strongly in the
                          super-natural untill now (and you think that pissed
                          them off). You are about to give up and accept  
                          death when you come across a city! Maybe there
                          are people alive there! Maybe there are fresh 
                          supplies! Or worse yet... maybe the undead, or
                          even worse... perhaps enemy soldiers could be 
                          lurking in that city. Only one way to find out.....

                          the city as loud as if you were right there. That

Levels-

All levels have the same amount of monsters, the powerups and items are 
different however.

All levels    Have weapons (duh), ammo (duh again), Armor, Blur spheres,
              and monsters.

1 and 2...    Also has medkits, stimpacks, (and other healing powerups), along 
              with the BFG. Plus- there is a Computer Map, an Invunerability 
              Sphere, and Light Amp Goggles.
              
3...          No healing powerups, no BFG, but still has Computer map,             
              Invunerability Sphere, and Light Amp Goggles.

4 and 5...    None of the above


Addtional Information...

This is a pretty complex deathmatch wad and is for those who like some tricks
and hunting in their deathmatch games and not just a square room with a frag
every second. There are a good deal of secret areas and traps, I have checked
everthing over and over... there are NO good places to 'set up camp', even 
places that look great for that, have a safeguard (something like a crushing
ceiling activated from elsewhere. It may be a good idea to have allow all
players to have a quick look at things before getting started). There are,
however, MANY places to hide. Many nooks and cranys and lots of shadows :). 
However- everything seems to balance out... email me with any comments or
suggestions.
              
Also... watch out for bullet-proof windows. I came up with these babies while
just playing around with things (I was determined to build one). Both players
can see one another but neither can shoot each other... not with ANY weapon.
Also... some of these windows are not windows, but force fields (they can be
turned on and off). So... watch out :).

One more thing... almost all the good weapons are in traps... that is-
after you grab the weapon... a door closes behind you and doesn't open for
30 sec.. In that time you are trapped. Be sure to stay close to the door
so that when it opens and you try to leave, you don't accidently activate
the linedef again (and trap yourself for another 30 sec. :) ).
