Misc. Author Info       : Just your average Doom fanatic

Description             : This level is designed for a single player,  
                          although cooperative play is also good.  
                          I've tried to throw a little bit
                          of everything in here.  You may have to die quite
                          a few times before you can make it all the way
                          through.  ** Hint ** I believe it is sometimes 
                          better to run than fight. I've also included
                          a demo of yours truly completing the entire
                          level on skill 4.
