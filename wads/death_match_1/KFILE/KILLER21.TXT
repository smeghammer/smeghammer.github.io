Description             : After playing many wads in deathmatch mode, I
                          decided it was time to try to create one of my own.
                          This level has many sniping places.  There is a 
                          central teleportation room that takes you to the
                          other areas.  Each area will almost always have a
                          way to shoot at someone in another area.  There are
                          switches that allow you to open an area previously
                          unaccessable.  Sometimes they open shortcuts to 
                          another area as well.  As I said, this was 
                          originally designed to be a deathmatch level.  
                          However, as I got further and further into making
                          it, it got kinda big.  It's still a good deathmatch
                          level for 3 or more players, with 2 players being
                          a little bit harder to find the other person at 
                          times.  There are quite a few smaller monsters, and
                          several of the big guys as well (Most of whom you
                          can avoid without having to fight them).  What can
                          I say, the guys I play with like to have something
                          to distract other players so they can sneak up on
                          them even better!  It might make a good single 
                          player level, but it would be pretty tough!
