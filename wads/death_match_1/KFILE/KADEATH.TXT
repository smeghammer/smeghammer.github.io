Description             : A huge, fairly straight foreward level that is 
                          is my second attempt at designing a new wad.  I
                          do not have any real story behind designing this
                          wad.  However, you should be able to complete this
                          wad without the use of any "special commands".
                          The reason I started building this is because I 
                          have played most of the other wads out there, and 
                          I thought I could do a better job.  Boy was I wrong.  
                          Building a good wad, takes time and patience.  Neither
                          of which I possess alot of.  Happy Hunting.

Help Me Out             : Let me know what you think about this wad.
                          You can send me a note on AOL, to "davidpez".
                          If I get a positive response, I am sure I will
                          build bigger, stronger, dangerouser, dirtier, 
                          crazier and stanger wads than you have ever seen 
                          before.  My mind is thinking of new ideas already.
                          By the way, if it after midnight and your reading
                          this; go to bed, doom players need their rest.
