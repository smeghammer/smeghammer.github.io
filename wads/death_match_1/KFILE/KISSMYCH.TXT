Misc. Author Info       : First deathmatch-focused PWAD
                          Second PWAD ever - first was a single-player
                          focused level called ZAPHOD11.WAD which included
                          new graphics, sounds, and special effects.
                          Should already be available at most Doom FTP sites.

Description             :       This one should be good for a change.  
                          So many PWADs I've seen look like they've 
                          been thrown together in a couple hours.
                                Dark circular arena with large spiral staircase
                          in center under main skylight.  Various concentric
                          corridors, rooms, and lifts at different heights 
                          and vantage points.  Detailed texture mapping and
                          original architecture.  When I put the monsters in,
                          they looked right at home!  Especially that sun-
                          sucking, fire-wielding Arch-vile and those sniper-
                          like heat-seeking missile-launching Revenants!
