This is our first offering.  It's the first substantial level we've written,
and we did a LOT of learning about DEU while building it.  All in all, we
spent scores of man-hours on it (please don't tell our advisors!), which
might not have happened if we hadn't kept changing everything.  We'd
appreciate any feedback you'd like to offer us.

We're already well under way designing levels 2-9, and hope to have them
done soon.  Hope you like it!

Description: 

First in a series of nine maps which together will comprise the "It's a
Bastardly Day in the Neighborhood" episode.

Level 1:  Well, you made it out of Hell all right, but the second you get
home, you hear teleport sizzles all around you...those bastards have
followed you!  Looking out the window, you can see they've got the
building surrounded...and you can hear the grunts of mutant soldiers coming
from inside your door...

You've fought those bastards on their own turf and won.  Now they're back to
even the score.  Fortunately, you've got a few tricks up your sleeve...
not to mention your general issue pistol...
