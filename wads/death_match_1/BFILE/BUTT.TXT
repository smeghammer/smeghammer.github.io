Title                   : BUTT.WAD
Author                  : Brian Hart
Email Address           : ind00045@pegasus.cc.ucf.edu
Misc. Author Info       : Just a college student with too much
                          time on his hands.

Description             : This PWAD is for E1M1.  It was designed primarily
                          for deathmatch, which is apparent in the design.

Additional Credits to   : Bill Archer, Joshua Levens

Additional Notes        : As stated above, it was designed primarily for
                          deathmatch.  It would suck in single player mode,
                          mainly because there's no end-level (yet).  :)

                          Please send me any comments or suggestions for 
                          improvement.

Authors MAY NOT use this level as a base to build additional
levels.  In the future I plan to place an end-level and make a series of
wads.  After I'm done with the series then you'll be free to modify.
