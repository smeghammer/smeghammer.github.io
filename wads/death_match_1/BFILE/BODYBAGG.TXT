Author Notes            : This hideous creation is my first attempt at 
                          making a doom level.  I hope you find that it
                          tests all of your doom skills.  I am very proud
                          of the first room (has been called "the court-
                          yard" by my playtesters), you will grow to hate
                          that room.  Good luck to all!

Description             : Teleported into a frenzy of violence your
                          mission, should you choose to accept it, is to
                          waste as many mutants that you can and escape
                          alive!

Level notes             : This is a small to medium sized level with lots
                          of grunts and lots of action.  Start moving
                          as soon as the game begins you will need to. If
                          you are good enough you can end this level with
                          all of the weapons and loads of ammo (if you
                          don't get a shotgun you are not playing right).  

Misc.                   : Making this level was a good learning experience.
                          I now know what it is like to have an obssession.
                          I urge anyone, that hasn't already done so, to
                          get involved in editing doom wads.  It is very
                          very addicting.  It is also very gratifing to
                          have your friends become horrified by the
                          violence you unleash.
                          Don't forget em oh oh en spells tool.

Special Thanks to       : ID for this great game.
                          Mike for getting me hooked on it.
                          Chris, Andy, Kyle for letting me watch their
                           reactions as they played my wad.
