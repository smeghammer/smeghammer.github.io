Misc. Author Info       : Doom! rocks my world!  I can be reached at
                          the above address, but place my name in the
                          subject...

Description             : This level was originally designed as a death
                          match level.  I threw in some monsters and changed
                          the layout to make it a playable level too.  Its a
                          pretty quick level to clear though, due to its
                          simple design.  As a Death Match level, its a pretty
                          fun romp.  Its designed to give the feel of having
                          three floors on the same level.  The bottom floor, 
                          The Sewers, has the basic weapons.  The middle floor 
                          offers some beefier fire-power. The top, tech-level 
                          floor has the big-mommas.  So the flow of battle is 
                          upward.  It tends to be a pretty fast-paced kill-
                          fest.  There are plenty of places to commit suicide, 
                          for those so inclined 8^)

                          Note that there are 2 exits to this level.  Note also
                          that this level is a secret level.  The first exit
                          is the normal exit.  The hidden exit (nearby) brings you
                          back to this same secret level.  So it is possible to
                          loop this level.  This makes it easy to play to a certain
                          number of kills.  When you have x kills, run to the
                          second exit.  The second exit brings you right back for
                          more carnage!!
