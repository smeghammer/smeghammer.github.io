Misc. Author Info       : This is my first attempt at making a WAD.
                          I spent over 60 hours getting it to this 
                          point.

Description             : This layout of this level is based on 
			  where I work.  I would mention where this is 
			  but I think the idea of killing and maiming in 			
			  the work place would violate our stated 
                          corporate values.  
                          
                          This level starts out in the pilot plant.
                          You must walk into the plasma to get the
			  blue key to get into the offices.(unless you 
			  have time to look for a secret door)
		 	  
			  As you walk across the loading dock into
                          the offices and research labs you will notice
                          that some areas are very crowded.  It may be 
                          a good idea to get the fighting started in a 
                          room then leave and let them fight it out for 
                          themselves. I have experienced some slow down
			  when playing due to the number of monsters so
		          I highly suggest playing this on a fast machine!
		          (I run it on a 486DX2/66 with 16 meg) 
				
			  I don't think it is possible to get 100% for items
			  (unless you cheat.) Some items are unreachable and
			  are there to enhance the scenery. (ie. life vials on the 
			  lab bench tops)
			 
		          I will be releasing a DOOM ][ version of this wad
			  with slight modifications but the layout will be 
			  just about the same.  

Additional Credits to   : My wife Claudine,for being patient. 
			  Tyler, my son, the 8 month old Doomer.
			  Dave Fistner for his interest and beta-testing.
