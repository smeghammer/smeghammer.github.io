Description             : Brown and Gray, lots of monsters.
                          My fourth wad, and the first one
                          where I paid very close attention
                          to textures and texture alignment.
                          COOL level. Very hard, but is just
                          fun to run through. Spends a lot of
                          time outside, and  has a stairway to
                          the basement of DOOM. Has a demo, so
                          just sit and watch if you get stuck.
