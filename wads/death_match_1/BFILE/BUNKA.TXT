Description             : This level is best for a three or four
			  player deathmatch game. One player 
			  defends the bunker, the other players
			  have to cooperate in attacking the
			  bunker. All players start in the same
			  room, but the first player into the
			  teleport ends up inside the bunker
			  ready to defend against the others.

			  The defender has lots of health and
			  ammo inside the bunker, but only one
			  life (once dead, you start back
			  outside the bunker again). The
			  attackers have as many lifes as they
			  need, but only limited weapons and
			  health. To 'break' into the bunker
			  and kill the defender you have to get
			  past several rooms and time locked
			  doors.

			  Once the bunker is cracked and the
			  deffender is killed, spread the word
			  and start fragging everything in 
			  sight. 

			  To see how to defend and attack,
			  watch the demo bunka.lmp, using 'F12'
			  to spy through the defender and 
			  attackers helmets.

			  Play the game with deathmatch 2 rules
			  (Using -altdeath) no monsters and on
			  skill level 1 or 2. If you think 
			  you're really good at storming the 
			  bunker, play on skill level 3, then
			  two defenders can teleport inside
			  the bunker!

			  Skill level 4 (Ultraviolence) is for
			  single player mode only. To play this
			  you must use dehacked Vr 2.0 and the
			  bunka.deh patch file which turns
			  red pillars into machine gunners.
