Misc. Author Info       : This is my second wad, my first was strmstr.wad
                          Stairmaster. I'm 18, and love jazz, DOOM, and
                          my saxophone.
Description             : Dark and Forboding, a trip into the dark side
                          of Diemos. Has numerous teleporters, and a few
                          stair cases, just to keep up with my first wad.
                          Their not huge, but very interesting. Didn't 
                          implement and secret doors or sectors. There are 
                          many Barons of Hell, and one guarding the blue key
                          on a platform (hence the title)

Editor(s) used          : Deu 5.0,5.1 Bsp 1.0
Known Bugs              : At the bottom of the really high elevator (you'll 
                          know it when you get to it goes from -511 to 440)
                          when you cross sectors you get a gray flash. You can 
                          find a spot where you whole screen goes gray. Not a
                          problem, but really annoying if you walk slowly of
                          the elevator.
