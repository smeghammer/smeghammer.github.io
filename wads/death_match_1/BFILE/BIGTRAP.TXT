We had information from a 'highly regarded' source deep inside enemy forces 
that their main system could finally be penetrated by using a secret 
maintenance password.  You and Dora were selected for this mission. 
You were to penetrate the computer and  transfer of all of their data into 
the Suckulator 2000 hybrid bio-silicon storage box. You made it deep into 
the city and found a personal study terminal.  Dora hooked up the S2000 to 
her head and the dark one's personal PC and began transferring data.  
Almost instantaneously, she began to screaming, then dying in two minutes.  
Before her eyes blew out of her sockets, she screamed, "HELP ME!!!  RUN!!!  
HENRY, THEY ARE EVERYWHERE!!" 
"Run!!! Remember, the barrels and computers are your fiends........HELP ME!!" 

Quick, back down the secret tunnel!............................

LOOK OUT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
