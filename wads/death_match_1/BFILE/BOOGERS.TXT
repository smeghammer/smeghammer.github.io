Misc. Author Info       : Unemployed engineer, just graduated from
                          UIUC, with nothing better to do!  :)

Description             : You start off aboard your UAC Marine transport.
                          Out of a crew of 4, 2 have already gone down to
                          the surface and failed to report in at the
                          predetermined time.  You third crewmate has just
                          left the brigde when the ship suddenly goes on
                          Red Alert.  You try to hail him, but you can't.
                          You fear he's dead.  Somehow the Hell-Spawn
                          have boarded the ship.

                          Your only hope is to get down to the planet's
                          surface and destroy the generator room!

                          You take a deep breath, pull out your pistol, 
                          and prepare for the worst........

* Misc*                 : Definately a single player PWAD.  Too many
                          walk-triggered ceilings, etc to make multi-
                          player play reasonable.  (Of course, it could 
                          probably be modified by adding a few more switches,
                          but this is designed for only 1 player. Maybe
                          my next undertaking....  :)   )

                          This is my 1st wad.  So any comments (ESPECIALLY

* Copyright / Permissions *

Hell, I don't care.
Modify, add to it, build upon.  Whatever.  It'd be nice to be recognized
in the credits if you do anything to it, but frankly, my dear, I don't
give a damn.  :)

Just be sure to distribute this TXT file with the WAD if you decide to
