Description             : A simple little bridge (sorta). It works like one
I kinda put in a few neat things, at the beginning, which you'll probably find
fun. It doesn't really take a lot of work to make a level this small, but
it DOES function as a bridge, and that's why I made it. It's not really a
level you play, more a level you play once, and then use in your own levels.
I hope you enjoy it, I know I enjoyed making it.

Additional Credits to   : Somebody on CIS, who posted a message asking
                          about bridge possibilities and gave me the idea
