Description             : This wad was designed solely for DEATHMATCH.
                          No bloodbath arenas here!  If you like a wad with 
                          a lot of ambush points and stalking positions, this
                          is the one for you (I enjoy it, anyway). I've never
                          played this Wad in a 3 or 4 person DEATHMATCH, so 
                          if you do, I'd like to hear how it fared.  I'd also
                          be interested in seeing any LMP's made in this Wad.
                          I'd also be interested in hearing any comments of
                          what you thought (This is my first Wad, so please
                          be merciful!).
