		::: ADDITIONAL INFO :::
================================================================

Let me start by saying that this is an exact conversion of the Stack level from Goldeneye on
the Nintendo 64. The only things that you will find changed is some of the item placement,
some of the deathmatch start locations, and in the main room there is a small raised
platform that keeps the room from looking too dull. This map is not supposed to look
pretty. It uses the grey/green textures throughout the map because I wanted to keep it 
faithfull to the original version. I think I should also mention that this is my very first
level I've ever made for a first person shooter. My previous map creations were in
Interstate 76, Battlezone, Red Alert, and Starcraft. I find that I pick up on map editors 
pretty quickly though, so you should not find this level to be substandard in quality. I 
hope that this map brings back some good memories of fragging your friends on the N64, and
for you people who never played Goldeneye, I think your in for a treat. This level has an 
excellent layout that makes for great fights! Enjoy, and please send me feedback, I'm eager
to hear your opinions on my map!
