================================================================

This is my first ever map made for any 3d shooter...Its meant to be a 
small map with lots of death and carnage...It may not be the greatest
looking map around, but it's MY map and I'm damn proud of it. I give
props to my friends Specops and SOG for their help (Specops REALLY 
wanted a carnage map) and to people  out there in the HL community
like Hellbringer for their help..Thanks!
