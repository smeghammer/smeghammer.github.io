Title                   : Circle Of Death

Description             : Halflife DM level for 2-6 players. 
			        This is an ARENA-ish style DM map good for 
			when you just have a few players and want to 
			quickly GIB!!.  An arena with 4 bunkers at the
			4 corners... with a bunkertower (motherload on steroids)
			in the center. You must enter the water to get into the tower.
			Water is a good place to set tripmines to cover your back :)).
			This is an extremely simple map.  I made it as plain looking as 
			I could to help with lag.  This map will be best on a LAN due to
			the large viewable distance.  It is also recommended for high-end
			machines. I RECOMMEND players to set "r_decals 0". As with my first
			map you will get a max decals error if you play this level for a
			period of time without reloading.

Designer's Notes

This is my 2nd map.  I am partial to LAN arena style games.  This map is in no way built
for lavish visuals or intricate architecture. It is simply for a few buds to drop the 
bomb on each other :)). 

Suggested environment is a high-end machine on a LAN

I RECOMMEND players to set "r_decals 0". As with my first
map you will get a max decals error if you play this level 
for a period of time without reloading.

Installation

To play this level, extract the file "coddm.bsp" into
your half-life\valve\maps directory and then start the game.
Start a deathmatch server and type "map coddm" or "changelevel
coddm" in the console.
