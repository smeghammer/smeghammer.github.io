Description             : G'day,  couldnt resist making at least one
			  map for this great game.
			
			  Need a theme? Its an abandoned 23rd century
			  chocolate factory.  You have arrived at work
			  3 hours late, and your workmates are pissed 
			  off.  Its up to you to waste all those snooty
			  co-workers because you are sick to death of
			  stirring the cocoa vat, and besides... their 
			  constant jibes of "Freeman is a llama" have 
			  really taken their toll over the last six years.

			  Why is a chocolate factory littered with heavy
			  weaponry?  Because chocolate has been a precious 
			  commodity since the Great Chocolate Wars of the
			  22nd century, and all remote chocolate outposts
			  are now keenly guarded.

If you still have q1 on your hdd and haven't played
"After The Fall" then its time you did. Some say it
was the inspiration for Half-Life.  Try it out, and 
judge for yourself.

If you never played Painrift (DM mod for q2) then 
thats ok, the servers were few and far between.
Still you should download it cos it had some cool
maps, weapon effects, etc. and it runs great on a 
lan.

Both these games are free, weigh in at over 16 meg
