This map was created to try to duplicate one of my favorite Marathon netmaps
(I don't know the original authors name, so if it's you,
please e-mail me and I'll give you credit for the design).

There are enough starting points for 14 players on this map.
There are five hallways at the bottom level, and in each one is a teleport
that will take you to somewhere different on the map.

To install this map, put it in your Sierra/HalfLife/Valve/Maps directory.

Enjoy, and feel free to e-mail me at:
