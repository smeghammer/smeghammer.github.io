This here map is my first at building a level for Half-Life
and I like to think I did a good job for my first time.

This map was based loosley on the Rainbow 6 training courses.
I made a shooting range,a office,and some extras.I know its
pretty sparse in the way of space used but I figure hey I need
space to run away :-)

CopyRight:This map isnt the best so if you use this for anything
for profit I seriously doubt your intelligence....but anyway you can do anything you want to this map as long as you give me credit before you
hack and slash it ;)
