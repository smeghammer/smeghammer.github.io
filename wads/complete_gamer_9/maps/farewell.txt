Description             : Halflife DM level for 4-8 players. This
                          is a conversion of my Quake2 map that
                          appeared in Level Infinity's Red Rover
                          mod. A couple of stuff has been added, but
                          basically it's the same architecture. 
                          There's a PA announcer in there that adds
                          a little flavor.
Special Thanks to       : Autolycus for comments, Valve for creating 
                          Halflife, #3drealms Undernet for being a
                          pain in the butt.
