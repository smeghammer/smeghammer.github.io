================================================================
This map is my first, and is also my favourite deathmatch map for a small amount of people.

The max players is 8, but I recommend a smaller amount. 

I've used many types of floor surfaces, placed objects, and stuff in such a way that the player, once he/she has studied the map and knows where those surfaces/objects are, can pin-point the enemy's exact location on the map.

This map is a ton of fun, even with only two players!

ENJOY !!!!

HINT="There are a few little, um, secrets around the map."

*** NOTE: I know there are few bugs, but I couldn't fix them! ***

*** KNOWN BUGS: ***
1) Sky is shootable?
2) Can't shoot through the metal grates.

Those are the only 'bugs' on the map that I know of.
Don't e-amil me about the metal grate story. I know how to be able to shoot through, but then again, rockets,grenades, satchels, etc. would also go through, so I rather made them not like that.

If you find any other problems, please e-mail me. (headcrab@pcm.co.za)

I'm going to be making a larger map soon (about 2-16 player), with the same style as this one.

THANKS FOR DOWNLOADING THIS MAP !!!
