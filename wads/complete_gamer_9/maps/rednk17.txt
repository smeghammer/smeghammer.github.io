Description             : Small to medium multiplayer
			  level. We've tested it with 2 players and
		          get a real kick out of it, but it's big enough for 
                          a bunch of players (maybe 6 or 8?).

Additional Credits to   : Everyone responsible for Half Life, a
                          truly amazing game.  Also, special thanks to

* Other Comments *

Yes, I know the "green toxic waste pits" theme is a little trite by now,
but I don't really care.  This is a fun map.

I also made crawl02.bsp, but I think rednk17.bsp is a better multiplayer
map.  Tell me what you think.  I'm still learning to make maps.  I tried to
keep the r_speeds from getting too out of hand for my Celeron 266.

This map has at least one good sniper / camper spot... it's also where the 
crossbow is, but you'll need to go around the map to find more ammo for it.
Though you might not think the crossbow would come in handy on this map, 
a decent player can make great use of it.

It's a little tight for the rpg in places, but I tend to like this insanity
factor in a game map!

The egon is in a place where it's VERY easy to get sniped... watch out for
crossbow-wielding players under the stairs...
