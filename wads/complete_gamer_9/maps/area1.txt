Comments:
The map is for people who like tactical firefights. I warn you now, run into 
a room blasting will get you killed very fast.
This is not my first level but it's the first i've "let loose" so i hope you it.
As you may notice the level design is not the best but i hope the gameplay 
makes up for this.
