Description             :  We've all wondered, and now we know.  What have we wondered?  Why, how exactly *did*
			  good old research assistant Gordon Freeman become such a grunt-busting, alien-crushing,
			  gun-toting, ramboesque renaissance man, anyway?  Simple.  He worked out with the 
			  security guards in the Black Mesa Training Grounds.  Not that simple Hazard Course, but 
			  rather the Live Target Range.
			   To be fair, we should say that they only used laser sighting which interfaced with the 
			  HEV suits, providing the combatants with up to date data on who killed who.  But since
			  Black Mesa is pretty much trashed anyway, it's open season for everyone who wants to 
			  prove that they are the biggest, baddest ass-kicker in the whole of Black Mesa and
			  beyond.
Author's Notes          :  There is a distinct lack of "high tech" in this level.  It is a down and dirty match
			  that highlights speed (the rooms are quick to traverse, no long hallways) and strategy.
			  If you get yourself into the right position, you can expect to rack up some serious 
			  frags, but it should be nigh impossible to come away without dying in the process.  At
			  least if your opponents are any good at all.  My suggestions to anyone playing this map
			  include: don't tailgate, make use of the level's connectivity, and watch those 
			  dispensers!
			   If you're a server admin and are planning on adding this level to the mapcycle, please
			  email me!  I want very much to play this level, and I'd appreciate any opportunity.
			   If you're a player and have comments, good or bad about this level, please send them!

			  to Rivazone for poining out Chas Inman's .plan . . . I can run in 1024x768 now!)

* Construction *
Base                    : Scratch
Editor(s) used          : Worldcraft 2.0
Compile Machine         : AMD K62-350 (OC to 400), 64MB SDRAM
Compile time            : QCSG - 14 seconds (.2 minutes)
                          QBSP2 - 23 seconds (.4 minutes)
			  VIS - 250 seconds (4.2 minutes)
			  QRAD - 3341 seconds (55.7 minutes)
Compile Notes           :  Adding a couple of parameters to qrad shot the compile time up at least triple what it
			  had been before.  Not sure if it makes a difference in the way the level plays, but it 
			  was suggested on many of the editing sites that I've visited.  This is my first DM 
			  release for any game, and as such may have some unforseen problems.  At this time there
			  are no known bugs in the level, and it has been playtested in multiplayer mode with only
			  one player.  If you discover any issues, please report them to the above email address.
