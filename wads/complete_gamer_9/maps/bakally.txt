* Level info *

First level from me not using the Build game engine.  Nothing too trick 
here, just tried to make a fun level for up to about 4-8 players.  I may 
do this level in a single player version if I get favorable feed back.

* Previous work *

Hoovrdam and Hoovrtwo for Duke Nukem, Hoovrbld and Caleb's Tomb for 
Banzai's Blood Add-on Episode and some work on the other levels in 
the Add-on.
                                  
* Legal Stuff *

You may distibute this level by any means so long as you 
include this text file and give me credit. If you compile this on a 
CD I'd like a free copy please :) (use e-mail address above, if you can't reach 
me that way..go ahead and use it anyway, I trust you will try)

You may use this as a base but without the .rmf or .map it's kinda impossible.
