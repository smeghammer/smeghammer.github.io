Description             : This is my first try at making a level (have you heard this before?) for any
                          3D-shooter. It has been great fun, and it took me about ten hours including all
                          the time it took me to figure out how to use Worldcraft. 
                          I wanted something simple to start off with, and this is it. Not much, but hey, 
                          I learned alot. The level is based on my memory of a paintball-track I have 
                          run around in a time or two. 
                          It is a very small level with very narrow halls and it is built like a maze. I
                          wanted something other than, "biggest guns win" and therefore this is only the 
                          357 gun to all the players. It is my hope that superior tactics and stealth 
                          would determine the winner here....
                          As I have said, this is my first try and I made a lot of beginners errors. So now
                          there is a lot of small things that I could improve in this level if I spend the 
                          doing it. But I wanted to start on a single player map , and declared this level 
                          to be finished. I hope you like it, and that you do not expect to much of it.
