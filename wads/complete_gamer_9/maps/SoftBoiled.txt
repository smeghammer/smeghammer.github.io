	Level Outline

This level is very loosely based on HardBoiled, by Hong Kong action director John Woo. 
The brief story line goes as so... Big crime boss type bloke is using a hospital as a front
for criminal operations. You are the number one type super cop fella, and thus your job is to
find said nasty man, and spread a little 9mm joy his way. 

	Level notes

I find this level pretty tough. Theres not much health, and theres quite a few nasty types to
get rid of. So all in all its a hard level. Be wary the coop level has a couple of possible 
paths and isnt obvious, so stick with it, hopefully you will enjoy it.

Ok this level is a cool coop level, which is what I really enjoy playing. But would also make
a pretty good deathmatch level with four people or so.

	Level info

This is the first level we have ever built in the cool Half Life engine. It would have been
a bit more detailed and visually more stimulating but the level is just to damn big. Making
this level as it got bigger was a nightmare. By the end of building I had a ton of vis groups and
a mass of entities.
