Description             : Halflife DM level for 4-8 players. This
                          is a small battlefield with hills, bunkers,
                          a turret and lots of carnage :-) Since
                          everything is in view it's not a fast map,
                          but hopefully people with fast computers
                          on a LAN will enjoy it a lot.
Special Thanks to       : Autolycus for comments, Valve for creating 
                          Halflife, #3drealms Undernet for being a
                          pain in the butt.

Installation

To play this level, extract the file "bfield.bsp" into
your sierra\half-life\valve\maps directory and then start the game.
Start a deathmatch server and type "map bfield" or "changelevel
bfield" in the console. To test it out in single player mode
start Halflife with hl.exe -console -toconsole -dev. This enables
you to try some stuff using the cheat codes.
