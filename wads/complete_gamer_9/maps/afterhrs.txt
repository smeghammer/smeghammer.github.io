Title                   : After Hours
Filename                : afterhrs.bsp

Description             : Darkness descends upon an amorphous 
			  office building hidden deep within a 
			  secret government facility. Not a 
                          single creature remains in the 
                          building after hours. 
 
			  Now's your chance to engage in bloody 
                          battle amongst yourselves, coating the 
			  freshly waxed tile floors with sweet 
			  red blood.

			  How cheesy. In reality, this is 2-6 
		          player DM map for Half-Life. It's 
			  kind of "Doomish." 

Special Thanks to       : Huge thanks to Reid "Brushboy" Kimball
			  for teaching me how to use WC (oh, so 
			  you've got to hit return to create 
			  stuff? Doh!) and advice. He also 
			  found a leak in the map, which I 
			  just couldn't track down. He rules.

			  Thanks to WhiteNoiz, Brushboy, tin and
			  warped for playtesting, and of course 
                          Valve for creating the best FPS ever.

Construction

Base                    : New level from scratch
Editor used             : Worldcraft v2.0
Known Bugs              : Some testers complained that the 
		          level was too dark, so I brightened
                          it up a bit. If it's still too dark
                          for you, up the gamma a notch
                          or two.
Build Time              : ~4 days of on and off work.
