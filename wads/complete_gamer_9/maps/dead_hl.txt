Description                     : Remake of the classic Doom deathmatch level Dead Simple
				  (Original author unknown. If you know, let me know so 
				  I can assign credit where due.)

				  Small tight level designed for 1 on 1 combat.
				  It's basically an arena style map with a bit of a 
				  walk in freezer style appearance to it but with the
				  same layout as the original Dead Simple. 
				  Plenty of weapons and ammo should make for lots of action.
				  There's a small recharge and supply station off in one
				  corner but using it will give your position away so 
				  look out for enemy grenades and satchels when 
				  you're inside.

				  Why remake Dead Simple? Well, I always liked it. It's
				  fast and action packed and it's an easy map to make.
				  I often use it as a warm up level for about 15 - 20 mins
				  to sharpen up my reflexes before going into a larger level.
				  It's my first Half Life map and the first time I ever
				  used Worldcraft so it was good map to get the hang of
				  the interface.

Base                            : Started from scratch. 
Editor(s) used                  : Worldcraft 2.0.
Known Bugs/Leaks                : Not so much a bug but a quirk of Half Life.
				  Some textures are part of random set that are applied
				  randomly when the game starts to make things look nore
				  natural. In this case the wall texture set has a vent
				  texture in the series. As result the number of wall
				  vents changes each time you start the game. I've
				  seen it vary from 2 vents to over 16 (which is too many).
