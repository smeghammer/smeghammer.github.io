Title                   : Gore Chasm

Description             : A recently abandoned government
			  facility hidden deep within a rocky
			  canyon now serves as a battleground
			  for two to ten players.

			  There's some things in this map that
			  I'm 99% sure haven't been done in
		          a user-made DM map yet. :) This map
		          doesn't suck ass!

Special Thanks to       : Thanks again to Reid "Brushboy" Kimball
			  for his infinite wisdom, along with 
			  tracking down a nasty 11th hour bug 
			  that probably would of prevented the 
			  map from being released on time. I 
			  honestly believe you can compare him
			  to Jesus Christ.

			  Thanks to Brushboy, Apache, Mix and 
			  warped for playtesting, and of course 
			  Valve for creating the best FPS ever.

Installation

To play this level, extract this file "gorchasm.bsp" into
your sierra\half-life\valve\maps directory and then start the 
game.

Start a deathmatch server and type "map gorchasm" or "changelevel
gorchasm" in the console. To test it out in single player mode
start Half-Life with hl.exe -console, hit the console button and
type "map gorchasm". If you put this on a DM server, let me know 
por favor.

don't sell it to support your drug habit. Thanks a bunch!

Other 

This is my second released map. My first was "After Hours," a 
fun little Half-Life DM level for two to six players. And visit
Planet Half-Life (http://www.planethalflife.com), dammit!

Let me know what you think of this map. Feedback, good or bad
would rock.
