This is my first map, and I thoroughly enjoyed the process.  I've learnt quite a lot and am
really looking forward to making more DM maps.  Unfortunately, I can't seem to grasp making
DM maps which are of Q2 or even Q1 style, but then, we're not playing Q1 or Q2 now are we.
I originally put way too much detail into the level.  There were originally book shelves
and couches and carts all over, giving it a really good feel of being an actual place.  I even
made my own set of wicked grated industrial type steps, but they had to go!!  I learned to
always keep my eye on the r_speeds and they are quite tricky to keep down, at least in my
case, thats when I had to go and deconstruct my level to add in the tunnels between large
areas.  The fully arched ceiling in the tunnels had to go aswell unfortunately.

All in all, I have no bitter feelings about the experience, and plan on experimenting with
alot of the commands needed to make good single player maps, 'multi-manager' being one of
them.  ONce I've got a good enough handle on these, and I have produced a few more DM maps,
I want to turn to making a small mini-game, with maybe 5-10 levels which would be small and
detailed and along the lines of the original game, with the cool 2 second load times and
stuff.

Anyways, enough out of me, I hope there are some people who really enjoy it, if you do, feel
free to send me an email.
