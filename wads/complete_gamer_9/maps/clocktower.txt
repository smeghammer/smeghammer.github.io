================================================================

I am primarily interested in making maps that are fun, not pretty.
So, I sorta skimped on the texturing. Im sure if this map gets
reviewed I'll get docked for the sloppy texturing, but that doesnt
bother me. If someone out there wants to do some texturing for this
and future levels of mine, feel free to contact me.
I recommend allowing flashlights on this map, and also turning on
realistic falling damage. 
This is my first Half-Life map - hell it's my first map for any 3D
shooter. I plan to do many more, primarily for TF2. 
About me: Take a look at my web site listed above. I work as a
game designer for a company called Zono. 


Enjoy!

Jason
