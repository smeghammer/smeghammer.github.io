Description             : Well here is my first (and very possibly my last) attempt at a 
			  Half-Life level!! Its aimed at being a decent multiplayer level
			  that doesn't feel as futuristic or sterile as the official 
			  multiplayer levels do.

			  I planned on simply taking the .map file from my q2 Manhunt level, slapping
			  in some new textures and entities - and BINGO! But no! ... oh no. I spent
			  quite a while learning how to effectively use Worldcraft, and loads of
			  time fixing all the microscopic errors Qoole produces - turning that
			  simple texture job I had planned into more of a full-time project :p 
			
			  I have no idea how I have succeeded with this map. I am sure, however, that
			  I have improved on everything that was "wrong" with my q2 version. I have ripped
			  out sections which weren't getting used, and strengthened and rebuilt other areas.
			  I can't say if it has worked yet, since I haven't been able to play the
			  level against anyone!!

			  Time will tell!!
