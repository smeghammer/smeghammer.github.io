Installation

To play this level, extract the file "labs.bsp" into
your sierra\half-life\valve\maps directory and then start the game.
Start a deathmatch server and type "map labs" or "changelevel
lab" in the console. To test it out in single player mode
start Halflife with hl.exe -console -toconsole -dev. This enables
you to try some stuff using the cheat codes.

================================================================

Site Seeing

The 'ZAP' room is one of two labs featured in the level. A little
ajoining control room allows you to activate the emergency defence
system incase an experiment gets out of hand. The defence system
will destroy all organic matter in the room, except for the Scientist
in Single player because he's immune or something.

The second lab has a huge Class V laser which is set up to fire a
beam around the room via mirrors. Whatever you do, DO NOT put limbs
in the path of the beam.

The plasma cells uses slime to cool down the plasma reaction. It is
recommended not to fall in as the possibility of you getting out again
is very small.
