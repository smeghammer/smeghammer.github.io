Description		:a datacore-style deathmatch map, of medium size.  You will note that 			 all of the alien weapons are not included, especially the lamest of lame 			 weapons the hornet gun.  In my opinion, if you can't aim on your own, 			 dont play the game.  In the intrest of lag I also left out the egon.  			 The various explosives (handgrenades, satchels, and  tripmines) should 			 prove VERY usefull in this level.  Once you find the  satchels, and 			 realize what a great vantage point you have for blasting  moles with 			 them, you'll know what i mean.  (By the way, that cannon is 100% Gray 	  		 Jack material, not a copy-pasted HMG from some example level.)

Additional Credits to   : Valve, for the game, Radium and all responsible for it, for the tips, 			 reviews and witty remarks (and this template), Half-Life Editing 				 Resource for information on that pesky trigger_tankcontrols, and my 				 roommates for letting me use their computer.
