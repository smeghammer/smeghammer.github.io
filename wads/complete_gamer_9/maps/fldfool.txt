Description             : This level took a long time to make and finally I can get
			  some rest from it... please feel free to email
			  me with your comments, but please no flames...
                          Please visit my webpage for future maps, and updates for this one.
			  **This map is meant for 4-12 players.
Thanks to               : Littlemute for his vickers MG prefab.  I put in sound and
			  increased the ROF but the main base of the prefab is there.
