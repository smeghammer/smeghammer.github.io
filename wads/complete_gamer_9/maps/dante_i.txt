Description             : A neat little 1-on-1 level that I cooked up. It started off as an 			experiment to see if I could actually finish a map. It's a high-up, 			pipe station, somewhere in Black Mesa. 
			  Be careful with those valves, the pressure in those pipes is 				dangerous!

                         It's a 1-on-1, but I've been told that it could hold 3 or 4.

**Any map-authors wanting the source files for this are welcome to** 
            **ask (they might just get something.)**

  Some suggestions on play (if you want them):
      
      -Hiding behind stairs,
      
      -Putting tripmines on the valve controls to stop people from turning them off,
      
      -In tense 1-on-1 situations, listen for the footsteps of the other player, 
	amplified by the metal flooring.
  Other notes:
      -This is my first ever released map. So be gentle.
      
      -R_Speeds are very, very annoying, especially for first-time authors. 
	This map is a week late due to r_speeds and they're still not perfect. 
	My apologies for anyone who is pissed off by this.
      
      -I had some great ideas for other DM levels and SP levels, too. 
	But, I got picked up by Radioactive Sotfware, 
	so I guess the next thing you'll be seeing from me will be HL:Level 5.
