----INSTALLATION----
Copy LRDM2.BSP into a sub-directory of half-life\valve called maps.

(i.e. c:\half-life\valve\maps)
Then run: 
	
	c:\half-life\hl.exe -console

Go into the console and type in "map lrdm2".

The .bsp extension should not be typed in, and neither the 
inverted commas.

---------------Play Information---------------

Level Name(s)        	: Seventh Aquarius
Single			: NO
Deathmatch 2-6		: More than 6 is certainly possible, but things might get tight. 			  
			  There are 8 deathmatch spawns, but probably only enough ammo for
			  6 or so.
Coop			: NO

Comments                : I started halfway with a metal-ish texture theme, then I decided
 			  that I wanted to create something more realistic; something more
 			  adherent to our time. So I built a concrete water processing plant.
 			  I'm sure Arrowhead Mountain Spring Water has a place  like this...
 			  Or maybe they'll learn from my design... I bet they'll be knocking
 			  on my door asking to purchase my map as a blueprint for the future
 			  "Arrowhead Shopping Center"...

			  This has been playtested (only in 1on1, though) and it ran great.
			  I have to admit, it was kinda fun :P

			  The walkways and doorways may be a little too thin (remember, the
 			  half-life player model is 32 units wide), the thinnest walkway
 			  being 64 units wide. My point: You'll get used to it. 

			  Also, about the ladders... I know ladders aren't great for
 			  deathmatch, but personally, I have no problem with them. I felt 
			  that ladders would be the most realistic transition from the lower 
			  levels to the top levels, and anyway, think about it  this way... 
			  If you were given a budget and had to build a water processing 
			  plant like the one depicted in my map, would you shell out the cash 
			  to have some guy build three thousand steps around your plant, 
			  unnecessarily expanding the surface area of your plant? Or would 
			  you  pay half the money and install some ladders all over the 
			  place... well, I know for a fact that welding pipes together and 
			  attaching them to concrete is a LOT less troublesome than building 
			  steps all over the place. Man, I need more sleep...
