This is my second map, and alot of its elements reflect the feedback I've 
gotten from my first map, pzmalice. If you use your ears as well as yer eyes, you 
will find that you can often get an idea where your opponents are lurking. I know that 
RPG looks out of reach, but there IS a jump module located.. somewhere. (well, you
could gauss up there, but it's tough) I also tried to make it a bit more visually 
interesting than malice was. 

This map was designed to be suitable for 2 to 6, but I tossed in 8 spawns, in case
you want to get crazy. I'm sure I'm not the only one who remembers those crazy 8-16 
Quake games in DM4 (The Bad Place). I've included all weapons except for the lag-blaster 
(egon) to support different styles of play. 

Thanks to everyone for their feedback on the first level, and especially to HellBringer
for his great tutorials! Also thanks to the whole crew on the planethalflife editing 
forum, including Goatboy, Hellbringer again and Ak-47.
