Title                   : Infiltration
Filename                : Inf.bsp
Author                  : Matthew O'Brien
Handle 			: Vortex (Play on UK Quake2 servers)
Email Address           : matt@world52.freeserve.co.uk
Description             : Small single player map (Story Below) and er, this is my first 			  half-life map so don't expect the world. Note the Worldcraft 			  	  tutorial room :)
Thanks to               : Jorden&Phil Inc.   email = ronpre@globetrotter.qc.ca
			  The war tents used on the helicopter pad are thanks to 
			  these guys. The r_speeds crap up around that area so I really
			  shouldn't use them but they are just too good to resist.

++ Construction ++

Base                    : New level (Extended from the half-life tutorial)

Editor(s) used          : Worldcraft 2.0, or "@#!! it's crashed again" as it became known
			  around my house. Damn they have to sort that program.

Known Bugs              : A couple of miss aligned textures on obscure surfaces that I 			  	  couldn't be bothered to hunt down. There is a major hit on   			  	  R_speeds just before heli-pad. I had to cut down on the number of 			  scientists that were being slaughtered there :(. Unfortunately I 			  didn't get the time to end the game properly so it simply fades to 			  black once you have completed the mission. There are also 			  	  rot_doors that sometimes open the wrong way!

Build Time              : Two weeks.

Comments                : I tried to gauge the level at a medium to hard difficulty. If you 			  are a bit crap at half_life by all means use god mode, but I 			  	  recommend that most people take it head on and "Do the Business". 			  The map is half the size I wanted it to be but I have exams and 			  cannot afford the time. Half-Life is the best damn reason I've had  			  so far for splashing out on that Voodoo 2 :)))

Story			: Story is as following : You are a marine called Gordon Freeman , 			  coincidentally, of course ;-) , who has been given the difficult 			  task of freeing a research instillation held by the military. The 			  mill boys are playing god and have taken the head researcher 			  	  ‘Einstein’ hostage. Your task is to wipe the floor with their 			  shiney new uniforms and free Mr Einstein. Your task might be 			 	  helped slightly by the guards who have tried to take their own, 		 	  if rather pathetic, initiative.
	

Installation		: First unzip Inf.bsp to C:\SIERRA\Half-Life\valve\maps

			  Run the game from a shortcut on your desktop (or wherever) that 			  has the following command line:

			  C:\SIERRA\Half-Life\hl.exe -console +map Inf

			  If C:\SIERRA\Half-Life\ is not the path to your hl.exe file you 			  will have to make changes accordingly. You can also leave off the 			  '+map Inf' command but you will have to type map Inf at the 			  	  console.
