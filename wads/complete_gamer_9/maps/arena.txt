Description             : This level is based on a custom level
			  that someone made for Duke Nuke'em. My
			  friends and I used to play it all the
			  time.  I couldn't let it die with Duke,
			  so, I threw this level together (not much
			  was given to make things look real). This
			  was necessary to reproduce the original
			  feel of the Duke Nuke'em level. Of course,
			  it has been tweaked for Half-Life, and
			  I made it from memory, but it should still
			  be recognizable to those who have played
			  the Duke version.

			  This level is a rectangular arena, about
			  the size of a large gymnasium.  There is
			  a maze on the floor, and a sniper catwalk
			  above. There is a main lookout which has
			  a large Gun (made by Mrpops, thanks!),
			  which I have customized.  It can also be
			  controlled remotely from the bunkers in
			  each corner on the ground floor!  Firing
			  it takes getting used to, but hey!

			  This level is VERY quick, and there is 
			  little cover.  It is fun with 3+ people.
			  For real fun, try organizing into teams,
			  and keeping everyone straight!  Enjoy!

			  I dedicate this level to Tod Stokes and
			  Erik Pikula, who made me love the Duke
			  Nuke'em level so much, that I had to
			  make a Half-Life version of it.

Special Thanks to       : The guy who originally developed the 
			  map for Duke Nuke'em 3D (Whoever you
			  are, I salute you).
			  Mrpops (Jose Garcia)...The guy who made
			  the big gun.
			  Tom Glorfield, Chad Bormann, Craig
			  Phillips, and Kevin Peterson, for
			  helping me play test, and for providing
			  feedback.
			  My wife, for her patience.
