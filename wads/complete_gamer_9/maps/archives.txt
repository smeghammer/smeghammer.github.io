Description             : This is my first Half-Life level.  It is a remake of the Military Archives from
                          Goldeneye on the N64.  The textures are very similar, and almost all the
                          architecture is the same.  I only added a pop machine and moved a few ammo and
                          weapons around.  It has been play tested and shouldn't have any mistakes.  If
                          too many players are in the game and all shooting the guass gun, the game might
                          slow up a little though.  It is meant to be more strategic than the usual pick
                          up items and kill levels.  It doesn't have any of the really powerful cheap weapons
                          like the rocket laucher, hive gun, and egon (lightning) gun.  You can shoot through
                          almost all walls with the guass gun making it very important to know where the enemy is.

* Play Information *

Single Player           : Only to look around.
Deathmatch              : Yes, 2 to 4 players would be ideal, more would become very bloody.
Difficulty Settings     : No

Extra Notes             : 1. If you shoot the powered up guass gun into one of the sliding walls, it will bounce
                             back at you and kill you.
                          2. You can shoot through all the doors.  It is very fun to kill someone through a door.
                             So listen carefully for door sounds.  Also try shooting through the floor to the upper
                             level.
                          3. After playing this level for 30 minutes or so the level will be almost all covered
                             in blood.  Neat!

* Construction *

Base                    : Level design ideas from the archives level from Goldeneye for the N64.
Editor(s) used          : Worldcraft 2.0

Known Bugs              : You can get the windows in the doors to get messed up if you block them over and over
                          from closing.  Just don't stand in the way of the doors.  The doors were really hard to
                          make with the transparent window in them.  If you know how to make doors like them,
                          please email me at nrmcc@usa.net.  Also the sliding door that is by the guass gun does
                          some strange things.  Stand perpendicular to the sliding wall on the side that is by the guass
                          gun (the side opposite of the hidden passage) and shoot a powered up guass gun shot
                          directly at the sliding wall and it will kill you!  Try it on any other wall and it
                          won't happen.  All four sliding walls have the same properties and are exactly the same,
                          but this one kills you on the one side.  Very strange.  Please email me if you know why.
