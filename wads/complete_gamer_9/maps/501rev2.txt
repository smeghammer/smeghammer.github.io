501 rev2
--------

This is a replica of the building I work in at Netscape... 
 at least part of it anyway.  In this map you will see the Help Desk 
where I work, as well as the server room and the lobby of 
501 E. Middlefield rd in Mountain View.

--------
things fixed from rev1:

Added new store room...
added new ambient noises...
Fixed some doors i didn't like....

------


Anyway, I hope you enjoy this map.  It's only the 
second one I've published, so I am interested in what people think.
