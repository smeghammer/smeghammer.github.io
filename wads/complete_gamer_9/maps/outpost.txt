Outpost is my first attempt at a map for Half-Life,
I did make a map for Team Fortress a while back, but
this one is much better :)

Outpost has a lot of open area for rocket fights, and
snipering, but there is also some cool places to
hide tripwires as well.

I had originally wanted to make the open area even
bigger, but because I'm running on a Voodoo 1, I
didn't want it to run as slow as some of the other
open-area maps (Bounce, for example)  This is the
reason for the resonably low detail rocks, etc.
