Title: 			Daquirus2 *for HL* =D
Filename: 		daq2hl.bsp
Author: 			Paris "lookout" Miles  age:16 I run http://www.
Email Address:		psmiles@mssl.uswest.net (may change ISP soon though..)
Description:		No where in particular.  Converted over from Quake and Quake2 
			because I really liked the gameplay and design. There are several 
			rooms all interconnected with a big room in the center with a tower.....
			The r_speeds are a bit higher from what they were in Quake and Quake2 
			but its more playable than bounce_dm. 

Additional Credits to:  	Rust for previous help with my mapping in Quake and Quake2.  Valve
			for making the kickass game I knew it would be.  Valve for including 
			WorldCraft with the game, even though I had bought WC 1.6 before =D.
			And all the people in #valve for their somewhat bittersweet feedback. 
			heheh.....

====================================================================

	p.s. If someone could point me in the direction than the Vising program that is better than
the one included with HL I would really appreciate it.  You see, the r_speeds in Quake2 never went 
above 500, (and that was FAST).  But even with the tremendous amount of detail I have taken out the 
r_speeds have risen to about 600 max, (slow).  So, if someone could make a better one, or maybe
improve on the current one it would realy help mappers....
