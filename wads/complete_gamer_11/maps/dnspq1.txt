Description             : This is a single-player level for Quake2                                                                               made in the "warehouse" theme. It took me                                                     some pretty long weeks to do and I hope you                                                                               will enjoy it. If you have something to say                                                    about this level, email me. But if you want
                          to flame me, explain, what exactly is bad                                                                                                                                   in this level so that I could improve my                                                                                                         level editing skills next time.
