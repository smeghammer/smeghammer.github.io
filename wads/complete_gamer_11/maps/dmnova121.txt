Description             : Nova 12 and it's crew were overthrown during
			  a prison riot when one of the prison crew
			  managed to short the force containment
			  fields. The remaining crew members were able
			  to escape from the separating control pod, leaving
			  the prisoners on board the ship to run amok
			  until another security vessel could
			  rendezvous and take back the transport hull.

Known bugs              : Not really a bug... If you play with bots you'll go blind. Oh
			  that wasn't it. Oh yeah, there are several lifts on this level.
			  The bots can traverse most of them because Lift Exits and
			  Lift Centers have been added, however they have a hard time
			  getting on the lifts that come up from the engine rooms because
			  they are raised slightly and are also push button controlled.
			  Although they do like to play with those buttons a lot. Maybe
			  they go blind and can't get on!
