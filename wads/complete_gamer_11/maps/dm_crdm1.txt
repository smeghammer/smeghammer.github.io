DM_CRDM1 V1.0

Ok, thats my first Unreal-Map and i guess i'll work a it a little more.
this level is a remake of one of my favorite DM_levels ever. 
It's called "Jailhouse Frag". I've had some features like lights that
turn walk on by and turn off after a few seconds, so it's possible to
see a invisible opponent (cool effect !!).  

So, please give my some feedback ... and mybe there will by a new Version
of this map.
