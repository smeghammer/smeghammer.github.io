Description   : Very big SPQ2 level. Coop starts included. No DM support

Story         : (please excuse my shit spelling)
		Rumours are rife of a secret strogg chemical plant on one
		of stroggos small moons. Recent recon expeditions have confermed
		its exsistance and that the strogg may well be developing some
		sort of product for use in chemical weapons. This must not
		be allowed to happen. A squad of paratroopers will be dropped
		on the outskirts of the plant. You will be ocompanying them.
		You mission is to destroy the reaction vessel deep within the
		chemical plant, It may even be underground, and then rendez vous
		with surviours at the surface and await the rescue party.
                
Bugs/Problems : The area with the brain just past the green lit pipes probably
		would be completely flooded in real life :)

                2) run quake2 like this
