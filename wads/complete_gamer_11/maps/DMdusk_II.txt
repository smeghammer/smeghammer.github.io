Author:VerMoorD

E-mail:Mick.beard@cableinet.co.uk

Build time:Roughly 1 week (add a brush..Look for the void...repair..add a brush..look for the void..repair etc etc)

                 ******************MODIFICATIONS********************

1) I have added a few more areas to the original DMdusk,making it much less linear and predictable
2) Removed "fogging" and "lens flare"
3) Changed the lighting effects.
4) Rezoned the entire map
4) Repositioned the pathnodes for better Bot play.
5) Tried to make it play faster in the bigger areas.

Thanks:My wife Lou and my buddy Damo for helping to test it out 
Notes: I (hopefully) designed this level for deathmatching for 2-16 players,Its "bot ready"so have fun :o)
I've tried to keep it as fast as possible and as detailed as possible but it's a hard task

Please dont use this level as a base for other levels or in a PAK without asking me first
Thank you and enjoy
