Extended description:
--------------------
Welcome to The Lower Shrine of Nakesh. Your escape pod has crashed on the surface of a mountain that surrounds the Shrine of Nakesh. After the wreck you and your companions stumble out, slipping down the edge of a cliff. You land safely but are knocked unconscious. When you awake you find that the others aren't in the immediate vicinity but certain items have been dropped out of your pack. You stumble to pick them up, wondering how to get down safely...


Author's Notes
--------------
This has been a real experience in learning. I would really like to thank the Epic team for a job well
done on an editor that is just amazingly simple to use once you figure out it's quirks. I'd also like
to thank them for a great game. Extended thanks go out to the people of #Unrealed, #UED and the rest
of the Unreal community.
