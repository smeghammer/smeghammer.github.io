==MISSION BRIEFING==
Listen up, soldier.  We have discovered the location of key Strogg tactical 
information. This information is extremely valuable to us, as it contains the 
locations and specifications of several major enemy bases, as well as enemy 
positions and supply line routes. You must infiltrate the facility and transmit this 
data to the Marine mothership. The Strogg have equipped the facility with transmission 
scanners which monitor all transmissions and report back to a nearby major Strogg 
military installation--if they get the alarm you'll end up scrubbed along with your 
mission.  Shut down the transmission scanners, then locate the transmit-dish and align 
it with the mothership's coordinates.  You must then find the central computer and 
manually initiate the transmission.
Intel confirms the facility is heavily fortified.  Good luck.
