Description
-----------
This is a medium-size deathmatch level set in a run-down bathroom that has been overun and
infested with little scurrying animals ( in this case, six inch tall unreal people :) ). So that you
aren't limited to just the big world, you can venture into the constructions that the rats...err
...I mean little people have built into the floors and walls.  There are plenty of traps for you to spring
on your unsuspecting fellow wee folk... so have fun!  

Author's Notes
--------------
This level combines two things that I love in a deathmatch level: Lots of height levels(sniper points)
and accessibility(being able to get anywhere by a variety of different ways).  You won't find any real 
dead ends in this level and even though it is fairly large, you can still get anywhere you want
pretty easily.  Hope you like it!
