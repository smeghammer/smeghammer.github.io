Description             : A Quake 2 map for deathmatch Play.

                          This is my first Quake 2 map and it's a kind of
                          'practice' level.  So I understand if you think
                          it sucks.

                          *Please* send me a E-mail about the good points
                           and the bad points of this map. Or just tell me
                           "I played it!".
