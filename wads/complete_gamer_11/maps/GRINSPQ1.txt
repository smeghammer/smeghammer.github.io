Description             : This is my first single player level set, which is
based in a castle/military complex on Stroggos.  There are 3 levels, but only
because my computers couldn't handle compiling the whole thing in one level :(  
I hope you enjoy this level set, and if you do (or don't) please feel free to email me
your comments. I hope it doesn't end too abruptly, but it is supposed to lead
into a sequel. Have fun!  

=======================================                          
THE STORY:

INTEL BRIEF: A class C Viper Cargo ship will take you to the drop zone
just outside a Strogg military and castle complex. It is suspected that
the remaining Strogg are housing huge interstellar space-craft armed 
with advanced biological weapons, and have plans to leave Stroggos and
assimilate ours and other worlds. Your mission is to infiltrate the complex,
locate the mothership on the ground, and board it before it takes off into
hyperspace.  Several tools will be at your disposal: your marine issue
blaster and shotgun, and all the Strogg weapons and ammo concealed at your
destination. Also, USMC explosive devices have been dropped to critical
points on the surface by Viper Stealth drop ships. Use these devices blow
holes in walls to access new areas or to disable the Strogg armament.
Just walk up to one to arm the charge, step back, and watch the show.  These
explosive charges may be vital to completing your mission intact.

SECOUNDARY OBJECTIVES: Over a dozen of our best soldiers have been
dropped to the area on the same mission. None have returned. We suspect
most have been killed or captured, and all survivors to be insane.
If you encounter an USMC marine proceed with caution. Get all the recon.
information you can from the marines and then execute them, believe me, its
for their own good.

And marine, there's a big reward in it for you, but
that's IF you make it back to base alive. A successful mission will be a 
critical blow to the Strogg collective, a failure may result in the
slaughter of countless millions. And soldier, go give 'em heck!

END BRIEF

* Construction *

Base                    : new map from scratch
Build Time              : Endless hours of design. I can't wait
                          until I get better at this so I can release
		          these levels faster. About 2 1/2 months.
Editors Used            : Too many :). 
                          WC 1.5b /w Q2 upgrade (crap) for initial
                          construction.
                          QERadiant (slow) at first to do surface props
                          and WC 1.6 after I eventually registered :)
Computers               : 166 MMX, 32 MB Ram, 1.6 gig hd. Pure3D (sloooo...)
                          200 MMX, 32 MB RAM, 2.3 gig hd. (..ooooow.)
	
Known Bugs              : -At the very start, If you shoot the gunner,
	                  the castle gate doesn't close, therefore
			  ruining the first mission. I should have fixed
			  this. 
			  -Func_rotating entities seem to disappear in SW.              
                          -If you pause the game after you set an explosive
			   charge, the countdown sound will continue, but the
			   actual time will not.  Moral: Once she's armed,
			   step far back 'til she explodes.
