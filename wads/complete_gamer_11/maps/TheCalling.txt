Extended description:
--------------------
	Your working late in the office again.. jeez you think you`d be able to get a break from work now
and again! You nod off infront of your terminal.....

Damn.. How long have I been asleep? What the hell! Im seeing things!?!?! Strange 4 armed see through
man walking around my office.. I have been working too much! Hmm seems like he wants me to follow him..
we considering this is obviously a dream.. what the heck..

The rest of the story is as myschas design compy states.. rescue the nali preist, (the bloke who appears
before you in a vision at the start of the level) from the clutches of the skaarj and krall forces.


Author's Notes
--------------
Damn I had trouble finishing this in time.. in fact at the time of writing its still not ready and
Ive had to cut loads of corners to get it done in time.. therefore I apolgise of the slightly scrappy and
unfinished areas. May I congratulate Epic for the best engine, the best editor and the best damn FPS single
player experience I have ever played. I got very depressed when researching my level and playing thro Epics
levels.. they are so awesome, I didnt think I could ever create anything as good.. well I think I didnt 
do too bad considering its my first lev.

BTW Please Email me with my opinions of my level, whatever you rekon of it. Its now I wish I had been less
lazy and emailed the people who made all those amazing quake and quake2 levels I got from Matts Single player
Heaven (sorry to see you go Bud) as I can fully appriecate the effort that goes in!

Update.. just finished the level, but I have to say there is so much I want to tweak and add, well
never mind.. just bear in mind.. this isnt the standard of my normal finished work.. Im much more
of a perfectionist normally :)


Copyright / Permissions
-----------------------
You may do what the hell you want with this.. I really couldnt care less, go ahead slap it on a few
CD`s, pretend you did it.. you`ll only be cheating yourself.. if you get fame fortune, money for 
exploiting me and my talents.. go ahead.. I believe in karma, u`ll get your just derserves :)
The more this level gets spread around the better in my opinion.. so go for it.
