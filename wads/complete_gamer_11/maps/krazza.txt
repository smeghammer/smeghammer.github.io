Description             : Your planet has defeated the Strogg
				  and an uneasy peace has returned to
				  the galaxy. However your leaders have
				  many reservations about the Strogg.
				  The genetic re-engineering of fallen
				  marines had shocked the public deeply.
				  And now they appeared to be building
				  secret weapon plants to manufacture all
				  kinds of monstrous tools of death. 

				  Being a biological scientist as well as
				  a veteran marine , you are the natural
			 	  choice for a reconnaissance mission. 

				  The Strogg are wary of the constant
				  attention, and when your team near
				  the Zahara weapon's plant they
				  attack.

				  In the skirmish that follows you
				  are separated from your squadron 
				  You scrambled over unfamiliar and
				  rugged terrain for several hours.
				  
				  Your only chance of survival is to
				  get into the plant find some weapons
				  and use them to commandeer a spacecraft
				  to aid your escape.

				: This level is dedicated to my girlfriend
				  who has tolerated my obsession, and 
				  has given me Quake1, Quake2, Worldcraft,
				  and Qoole to play with (how cool is that?)

Editor(s) used  : Worldcraft, Qoole
Known Bugs      : There might be a soldier stuck in

			word "planet" in all the computer
			updates.
