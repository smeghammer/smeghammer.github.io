What a great time to release a dm map eh? Well kiddies here it is my first dm map TheCrossings.
Using Unreal's mirrors and portals. Map contains 5 rooms, 4 connected to one with Portals. Each
room with it's own lighthing effect and weapon and ammo. I was lazy on this map not putting in
light sources so it appears light comes from anywhere, owell, enjoy!
Have fun and don't hurt yourself.
Disclaimer: There is *NO* bot support right now. I will be releasing a later version so you can 
            play with bots. Thank you and have a hectic day.

No one can reproduce this level or something, or I will be forced to open up a can of serious 
w00p ass...biatch.
