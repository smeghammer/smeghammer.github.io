Info:			This is one half of a rather large Q2CTF map 
			(on hold at the moment, until Dave gets off his behind...jk)
			The map was designed and built with GL use in mind.  If 'software' has
			probs...I don't care.

Description:		Dark and foreboding, the building wraps around you like the film that
			floats on a decaying bog.  You hear the enemy nearby, but cannot see them.
			The exit is a short distance from your current location - you jump up from your
			hiding place - the alarm is sounded.  A mad dash to a nearby elevator takes you
			up and out. Out to the exit.  Out to freedom.  But the door is locked...

			You must find your way to the key that unlocks the path to the outside.  You've
			been stripped of all weapons and armor, and must make do with whatever you find
			along the way. Ego says to fry everything in your path, a small voice tells
			you to be cautious.

			Where could these enemies be coming from?  Surely this is all there is?  
			You are	certain that this is the final battle...or is it?

Advice:			CONSERVE YOUR AMMO
