Author's Notes:
--------------------
I have paid a lot of attention to placing pathnodes in this level.  As 
well as the bots play, they do have two problems: 

1)They will not activate the smasher, and

2)They occasionally get trapped in the circular lift pits.

Other than that, they do really well (they kick my ass).
