Description:  This is my first Quake2 single player level. I made a few Quake 1 maps that were, well, not much to brag about. :) It's SP only, no deathmatching. This map is a major improvement over what I've done in the past, I think. Tell me if you agree.

Additional Thanks to:
              
Disruptor, for the answers when I got stuck
Mad Dog and others on the Rust message board for filling in the blanks
