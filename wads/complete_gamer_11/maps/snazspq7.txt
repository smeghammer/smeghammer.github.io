Story:
------

We have found a vital strogg outpost, we must destroy it however the exact location is still unknown. You must infiltrate 
the base and place an airstrike marker in the control room. We have teleported the marker into the base however we do not 
know the exact location as the teleportation was inturupted by heavy interfirence. Good luck marine.
