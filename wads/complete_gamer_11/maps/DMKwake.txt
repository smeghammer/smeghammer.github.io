Author's Notes
--------------
Well, as you may notice, this level is heavily based on one of the orginal Quake DM levels. To tell the truth I haven't played Q1 for about a year now and this map was all based on memories of 'areas' of the map. See if you can guess which map it is. ('cause I can't remember its name :)

Also see if you can spot the portals.. I think they work much better when you can't 'see' them.
