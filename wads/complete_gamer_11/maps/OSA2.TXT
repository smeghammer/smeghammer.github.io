                          Please let me know what you think about this
                          level. I really love feedback. Tell me your
                          honest opinion, thanks.

Description             : My second Q2 level. This level is a sequel
                          to my highly successful (hehe) Q2 level Old
                          Storage Area released in March 1998. I tried
                          to make this level as simple as possible by
                          using minimal amount of brushes but still
                          providing some nice detail and playability.

** The Story **

After Old Storage Area things have calmed down a bit, but the very heart
of the Storage Area facility hasn't been explored yet. It has been said
that there's a hidden portal lying somewhere deep within the facility but
no one has dared to enter that part yet. As strange as it may sound, the
only way for you to get rid of those memories that haunt you day and night
is to seek out the hidden portal and escape the Storage Area for good.
Your job won't be easy though... some have said that there are big and
scary monsters guarding the portal, whether this is true or not we do
not know. These things are up to you to find out.

After a few days rest since the first battle at the Storage Area you step
into the teleporter not knowing what you'll really be up against. In few
seconds you have traveled a long way and find yourself standing just outside
the facility. "This is it then", you think and load your weapons. Once again
you are trapped in the Old Storage Area...

** How to Play this Level **

Just unzip osa2.zip into your \baseq2\maps directory (create, if necessary)
by typing "pkunzip osa2.zip c:\quake2\baseq2\maps" or something like that.
Then just start up Quake 2, bring down the console, and type:

"map osa2" (without the quotes of course)

** A Few Words from the Author **

Well well... here I am again. Bet you all thought I was dead or something. :)
Hehe, ok... I promised I'd do another level for Q2 and here it is then.
I could have figured out a whole new... y'know, idea for a level, but when I
actually started creating a level on a cold Friday morning, I thought "Why
don't I just make a sequel level", which has always been on my mind. So this
is what I came up with, a sequel level to Old Storage Area but this time with
a different "environment". This level is more dark and gloomy in some ways
than the original one and it also includes some moving achitecture. You
wouldn't BELIEVE how many people emailed me after I released OSA and told
me that the level would have been much nicer if there only had been moving
conveyor belts in it. Well, this level DOES include one moving conveyor belt
and some other moving stuff as well.

I have been looking for a paying job as a level designer for quite some time
now. If you have a job for or if you can help me to find one, please let me
know (email to hannu.koiste@pp.inet.fi). I'd really appreciate it. Thanks.
