Description          : Ballistic is my first Quake 2 map. Designed for
                       single play (skill levels included) or deathmatch !
                          
  The Story:    You awake to the crackle of your com-link, the static
              broken intermittently by the gruff voice of your commander.
              "New Strogg threat", you think, "Great, just what I needed."
              "Inter-Planetary Ballistic Missiles......", the voice continues,
              "travel through wormholes to reach their target."
                "Inter-PLANETARY ?!, Geez, what'll these assholes come up with
               next ?"
                The commander quickly describes a hidden teleporter leading to 
              a Strogg missile silo. "Recon reports that the central launch 
              computer controls wormhole creation. Destroy it, and those ten
              giga-ton warheads are goin' nowhere ! Good luck, soldier."
                A thin bead of sweat breaks on your brow as you grab your
              pack and head for the telepod........
