Description             : Base map. Sort of an extended Where Eagles Dare(oh yeah?)
			  My first Q2 map, so i thought i'd take one of my old maps and modify it 			  to make the start a little easier. It turned out to be a pretty 			  independant map anyways (which was intended).
			  All weapons are there except the BFG. It simply didn't fit.

History			: Blah. Just took too long to do.
