Hi, folx.

It's me again, Larry Croft.

 Intro: Since it seems you liked my first map (DM4Seasons / 308 Downloads [10.51 PM / Juli 5th 1998]) I have created another one... quite some time ago, yes, but I have tried to implement Bot-Support. But I failed. Even with the help of some tutorials. If anybody could help me to create a Bot-Support for these two maps... I would really appreciate the help. If you do so, please insert some lines into the DM4Seaso.txt (DM1_1Atlantis.txt) which say that the Bot-Support was your work, and send me the new map and the readme. If possible, also write (but not in the readme, I would prefer it in the eMail) how to create a Bot-Support. You can call the file DM4Seas2 (DM2Atlantis), if you like, or maybe DM4Seasons2_0 (DM1_2Atlantis), or whatever, but please not DM4Seaso(ns) (DM1_1Atlantis). It would be bad for people who already have the original version...

 Description: Atlantis with its three rings... but before the big bath. It's large enough, but even with only four players quite playable... and interesting, because ya can't see 'round corners. It's good for snipers. Stand in one of the "arms", and wait till one o' yer opponents reincarnates at the opposing "arm". I'd say ya shouldn't use more than 10-15 players, it's not THAT big.
