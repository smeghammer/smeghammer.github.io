Description: A deathmatch map for Unreal, based on
             Doom2's map 1. Textures for this were
             extracted from Doom2, and imported into
             the included file called Doom2.utx

Usage of this map and zip: first of all, unzip DmDoom2.zip
                           into your Unreal directory. It
                           is set up to put the map in your
                           Unreal\maps directory. and
                           Doom2.utx in your Unreal\textures
                           directory, automaticly.
                           
			   (use the -d switch if you are using
                           pkunzip)
                           
			   If you have any problems unzipping
			   to the proper directorys, then just
                           just copy the two files listed above
			   to the directorys specified above.

Now you should be able to start a Multiplayer game and select Dmdoom2
in the map list. or open console and type this: open DmDoom2

Known bugs: found one texture bug, but its not too 
            noticeable. Besides i could'nt fix it anyway.

I kinda messed around with some of the sounds too,
for when you pickup some weapons and stuff like that.
So you may hear some strange things. :)

Also, most of the lifts operate only if the player
jumps on them. heh. I have to work on making lifts.
But they do work.

After you unzip the Doom2.utx to your Unreal\textures,
you can then load the textures found in it, in Unrealed
If you make a map using the doom2.utx, you will need to
include it in a zip if sending it to others. Otherwise
your map wont run for others. doh!

Have fun with this one!
I know Doom2 map01 has been done to death, but
i wanted to see sort of how this would look and play.
Hope ya like it. :)
