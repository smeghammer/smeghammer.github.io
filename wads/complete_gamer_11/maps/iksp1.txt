Map description         : My first Q2 single player map... Started back in
                          Finland before moving to US, before anyone else
                          had released Q2 single player maps... Finished
                          it now after 3 months to get rid of it. :)

Da plot                 : You're one of the sad individuals who were lost
                          during the drop operation in the start of Quake2.
                          You've enjoyed your underground holiday on
                          Stroggos for some time, when someone blows up
                          their "big gun", allowing a rescue operation.
                          Unfortunately, Stroggs still have air superiority
                          on this side of the planet so we don't have much
                          time...

Blahs                   : Didn't have time to make any big improvements on
                          what was basically my first Q2 map design...

                          This was also going to be part of a mini-episode
                          by me and Matthias Worch, but...

Other maps by me        : IKSPQ series for Q1, IKDM maps for Q2. Get all from
