DMInsanity Version 1.1
Produced 5th July 1998 by Bullet

Just an update on my previous version of DMInsanity. This one has tons more weapons and
better pathnoding (which increases the level's difficulty). Even with easy bots it is one
hell of a challenge and with 15 you don't stand a chance! With only a few bots it gets
slightly easier but is still pretty goddamn hard!! Keep an eye out for my next great map!!

Have fun Deathmatching
