Covak's Dungeon
An Unreal map by Covak (covak@idirect.com)

Description: A little deathmatch dungeon. Try it with 7 or 8 bots for total
             chaos.

NOTE:        This map is meant to be played with Coop Weapon Mode on.

Other junk:  This is my first Unreal map release, based on an old DOOM II map
             that I made years ago. It's really simple. Lots of killing. That
             music came with my GUS MAX. Thanks to whoever made it.
