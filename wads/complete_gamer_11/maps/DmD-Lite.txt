DmD-Lite
June 25th 1998
Colin James <Coldfront>

I'll be the first to admit, im no Debacle or Brick, so I decided 
to convert an already well designed map (imo). Here is a Quake 2 conversion
I've whipped up. This is my conversion of Headshot's D-Lite map 
(http://headshot.terrafusion.com/). I used to play this map all the 
time against Eraser bots before Unreal came out, and I emailed Headshot to
get his permission. Once I got it I began work, that was 5 days ago as of 
this writing. Would have finished sooner, but Real Life is a bitch most of the time :)
Right now this is pretty much a straight conversion from the Q2 map. All I did
was add one secret (its pretty obvious). So if you have any ideas to make this more
Unreal-like...drop me a line (cjames@henninger.com). Enjoy!

NOTE: I kept the weapon and ammo placement as true to the original Quake 2 map as possible.
So if I get enough complaints from you people I will release a 1.1 update to modify the
weapons/ammo placement :)

I would just like to thank headshot for giving me permission to convert his kick ass level :D
