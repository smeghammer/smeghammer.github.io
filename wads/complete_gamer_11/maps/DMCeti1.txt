Description             : Deathmatch level for Unreal. This is my first
			attempt at level design with UnrealEd. There's
			some parts of the level I like, some I dislike.
			Has some good architecture in it, but not fluid  
			throughout the level. It was a good learning 
			experience on how to use the editor. Includes
			8 deathmatch start spots, all weapons, and
			pathnodes for Botmatch.
                                                      
Additional Credits to   : Epic Megagames for an absolutely wonderful
			game and level editor! It was worth the wait!

Known Bugs      : Some "HOMING" in one area. This may be due to too much geometry in
		  certain areas. This was my first level with UnrealEd, still learning
		  how to do most things. Also bots seem to get stuck in one portal,
		  I didn't want to spend any more time to fix this.

	Level Editors, If you want your map to show up in Unreal when
selecting a Deathmatch game, prefix the map name with DM, if it is a
Darkmatch game then prefix it with DK.
