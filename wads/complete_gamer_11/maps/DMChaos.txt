DMChaos Version 1.0
Produced 29th June 1998 by Bullet

Hope you like small deathmatch arenas! If you don't, you shouldn't have downloaded this
one. This is one of my first UnrealEd maps, so don't judge it too harshly : I will get
better (look out for my next one, 'DMMadness').

Hope you enjoy it

Bullet
