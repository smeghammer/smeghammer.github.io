Installation
   Unzip the the files and place them into your maps directory
under the quake2 directory. Select your skill by typing in 
skill x (x being 0,1,2) in the console. Then type in
"map zebo1" which will start the unit. You exit the unit
into base1, the starting map for quake2.


Story so far... (this is long by the way ;)

   The war on the Strogg homeworld has gone well. We have established
a foothold on the outskirts of the main battleline and construction
of bases have begun. These buildings are built using Strogg material
and/or the old buildings themselves.
   Station Zebo is an example of this. We "borrowed" four buildings
from the Strogg and converted them to house a fission reactor. Why
use fission instead of the safer fusion reactors you ask? Simple, if
need be we could destroy it and radiate the Strogg if they happen
to retake the site.
   Well, unfortunately the enemy have retaken the site and the staff
were unable to set the self-destruct sequence. But they were able to
set some security protocols into place and the enemy does not have
complete control of the station. Also, the self-destruct option is
no longer available.
   Here is your mission, the Strogg have started using the reactor for
their own needs. This is bad, the reactor must be taken offline at all
costs. This means if necessary some marine must enter the reactor room
and destroy the main node to bring the whole thing down. This in turn
would radiate the room and everything in it, a blast door would shut to
keep the rest of the station safe from radiation. This is the last
option.
   Fortunately our experts think that the computer system is still
online and the shut down sequence would still work. But this also means
fighting your way into the heart of the station to start the sequence.
Once the sequence is started the computer system will allow you access
to the next point to complete the process. Once the whole system is
shut down your mission will be completed and you can return.
   You will enter the station through the storage section which also
contains the transportation system which will also allow you to leave.
The storage section has access points to both the water and waste
sections. These two sections have access to the control section. This
means that Station Zebo makes a circle with all the sections connected
with hallways. We at this time do not how the Strogg gained entry,
although they do seem to have the ability to appear in the most
uncomfortable locations.
   Here is the sequence to shut down the system. Inside the control
section are two locations that turn off the main water and waste
circulation systems. Then you are free to return to either the water or
waste section to disable the primary and secondary backup systems. This
then must be repeated for the other section. Once a section is shut
down one of two electromagnetic generators can be brought online. Once
both of these generators are online the reactor is taken offline. The
two generators will supply enough energy to keep the station 
operational but not enough for any outside use. This in turn will
render the station useless to the Strogg.
   But be warned, the reactor may be offline but it is still active
and can be destroyed. Be careful of gunfire within the reactor room!
   This is your mission, completion is necessary for success!


Known Bugs (this happens on my machine, your mileage may vary)
   It seems that for some reason restoring your game with the
automatic save function doesn't always quite work right.
Might want to make your own saves instead of relying on the auto one.
   If you leave one level with a door open and later return to
that level the door will be not be closed all the way. It
doesn't screw up the game it just looks weird, once the door
opens it goes back to normal.


Author's Notes
   This unit began as a little experiment of mine in multi-level
missions. The idea was to create levels that entailed one mission
that required the player to go back and forth between the different
levels a number of times.
  It is possible to play out these levels in different ways so that
each game will play a tad bit different. But the only real difference
will be how many monsters you encounter as you run through the levels.
But it does add a bit of replay value to the unit.
  I was originally going to have dm play with the levels but after a
playtest on zebo1 I decided that it wasn't worth it. The way the
levels are designed they make decent single player levels but suck
at dm play. Maybe I'll paste all four levels into one big dm only
level, we'll see.
   In my opinion these levels get a little boring on the lower
difficulty settings because you do a lot of running around and only
on hard difficulty do you fight most of the time throughout all four
levels. But I had to put the difficulty settings in don't you know :)
   You'll notice that each level is pretty much totally different
than the others. This is intentional, I wanted to try to give each
level it's own feel to make it easier for the player to realize where
they were without having to check the help computer. Plus the water
and waste sections was another experiment to see if one could alter
the mood of a level by simply retexturing and relighting to make
it feel like a totally different level. I believe it worked but the
machinery gives it away since I didn't design unique machinery for
each level.
   I learned a lot from this little experiment of mine. Some things
I'd do different but it turned out pretty good. 
   Thank God for graph paper!


* Legal Stuff *
   Well, this is easy, if you want to do something with it
other than play it or distribute it (for free of course), 
then you have to ask.
   Otherwise don't do it unless you ask.
   If you have to think about it before doing it, then you probably
should ask :)



Hints
   These levels make a circle, so there are several different
ways to go about completing the tasks necessary to complete
the mission. If you have problems getting through a certain
point, you might try going ALL the way around and attack it
from the other side.
   You won't find stuff lying around quite as much in the quake2
levels. You must make decisions whether to pick up that health
pack because you might need it on your way back. The same with
ammo which the monsters drop for you instead of just finding
them laying about. Conserve your ammo, if you only need 10 bullets
to fill up then don't take a bullet box since it holds 50 bullets.
   There are lots of doors, use them to hide in gunfights.
   Sometimes you can make a monster in its own stupidity kill
itself either from friendly fire or walking into the lasers
(which you'll see what I mean). It's kinda funny to see them
walk into the lasers in a sick sorta way.
   On the hard difficulty you might want to clear out the water
and waste sections before you complete the sequences to make
things easier when getting out.
