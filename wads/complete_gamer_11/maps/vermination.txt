*Thanks To*
Id Software, 
Ben Morris and Worldcraft, Joost Schuur at cdrom.com.
A special thanks to all of my good friends in the Quake community who 
hardly ever hear from me anymore...it's just been that sort of year so far.
My great thanks to Gene, Neil, Igor and espesially Paul, you convinced me 
that the target_speaker was a powerful tool as now I know it is. I now
regret building this entire piece without that in mind.

* HOW TO INTALL *

If you don't already have a folder called maps in your quake2\baseq2 directory
then create one in there.
Place vermination.bsp in the maps folder and start quake as you normally do.
Once Quake2 is running hit the (~) key and type in map vermination.
