Description: This zip contains an Unreal deathmatch
             map called DmDwan48. It is somewhat
	     based on the old Dwango4,map8 for
	     Doom2, and Duke3d. The map has six
	     playerstarts, and most weapons.
	     There are two playerstarts in the 
	     upper area, that otherwise can only
	     be reached by using the jumpboots.
	     
Editor used: UnrealEd
 
Bugs?: small sky bug that i mostly fixed by placing
       solid rectangles to block view of the area.

Usage: Unzip the DmDwan48.unr to your Unreal\Maps dir.
       Then when u start a deathmatch game, you should
       be able to select it from the list of maps that
       begin with "Dm". Sometimes i find Unreal crashes
       when i load this map this way. So i start a
       deathmatch game, and choose another dm map first.
       (like Dmtundra), then after i'm in this map i
       open the console with the ~ key (or use tab) and
       type this to go to DmDwan48: open DmDwan48
       That should work if Unreal crashes when u try to
       load the map from the menu. Maybe someone can
       Help me out in finding out why, and how to fix.

  (update note):

The crash problem mentioned has been fixed in this newer
version of the DmDwan48.unr, so you should'nt have any
problem just selecting it in unreal's multiplayer menu.
I just left the refrence to it in this txt in case 
someone has a similar problem. :)

Authors may use this as a base to build on.

Have fun!
