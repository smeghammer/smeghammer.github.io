         Thanks to Dome, Talons Strike, Spawns Lair, The Quake2 Deathmatch

Welcome to Terran Torture ! This is homers first attempt at making a
Single player level, and deathmatch too ! I must warn you that this
level is a pretty tough one. No wussies will make it to the end on
their first try here. Homer also tailored this map to play extremely
well for deathmatch also. The monsters will give you plenty of ammo
along with the stuff already placed by homer. There's one secret in
this map, and it will really help you if you find it(hint-crouch).
The computer helper will guide you through the level so you don't
wander around aimlessly. Watch for monsters in places you already
covered! This level is designed for use with medium to high power PC's
with ample RAM and 3DFX cards. Good luck and enjoy Terran torture.
Unzip the bsp file to your Quake2/baseq2/maps folder.
Type map homers7 at the console, and frag away !
All of Homers Quake 2 maps are available at ftp.cdrom.com,
and many Quake 2 review sites. If you want a DM level for
classic Quake, contact me by E-mail. I have some excellent ones.
