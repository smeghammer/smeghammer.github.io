DMMadness Version 1.0
Produced 2nd July 1998 by Bullet

Not much of a readme for this one! Just start it up!!
You'll like this one only if you like a fast and furious deathmatch with tons of kills.
Try playing it with 15 bots : Its INSANE!!! But watch out; nowhere is safe...

Special Thanks go to all of you out there who wrote all the UnrealEd tutorials.
Without you, DMMadness would never have been born!

Have fun

Bullet
