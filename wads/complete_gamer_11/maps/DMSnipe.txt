Info: Ok this is my first Unreal map and only 2nd map I've done for any game so if you think it sucks too bad.  I think it's pretty cool and expect major companies asking me to work for them.  Send praise, hate mail, and nekkid dali llama pics to down@unreal.org.  

I have added bot paths to it and the bots work great. Usually I play the map with 6 or less bots.  That's about it.  Hopefully you have fun with it.

"Please dont reproduce, sell, rip, modify and rerelease, blatantly steal stuff from my level, or do anything like that. You can put it on your UnrealServer if you have one though."  <-- Thanks for writing that for me BEG.

Oh and one more thing...Jeet s0cks
