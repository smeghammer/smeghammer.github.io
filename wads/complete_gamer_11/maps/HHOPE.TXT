* Notes *

Those two damn HOM errors (if you dont know what HOM is, you
never made Doom/Doom2 maps <g>) have got me stumped.  I tried
everything in the book to fix them, apart from redoing the
entire level.  Sorry if those bug you; they sure annoy the
hell out of me too.

If you dont own a 3dfx card, go BUY ONE!  Quake2 without gl
is not the same game ;)

This map was more of a learning project than an all-out
attempt at a top quality level.  A lot of the ideas in it
were done in part for the Quake Workshop 2 web site, so that
I can pass along as much info as possible to the rest of the
editing community about creating Quake2 environments.

Hope you enjoy it.
