Description             : Some time ago, I designed a quake level called "RIM." It 
			turned out to be very popular, distributed on several gamer disks,
			and was one of my favorite concept levels. You'll see why it's so 
			different when you play this new version for Unrea.

                          

        		 
Thanks to         	: No one but me. I did all the work. But, I do give credit
			to the creators of Unreal.

- Info -
Unreal Ed is tough, guys. No shit, and no shinola. Given the chance, I'd never have gotten
started designing these levels. But, I suppose it's worth it in the end if you guys like
the level.
Enjoy.

Do not use this level as a base for your own levels and as a source
for ideas. You are *not* allowed to make money out of it - meaning 
you're not allowed to put it on a CD-ROM and sell it.
I will give permission to gamer magazines that would like to include it on their CD's for
free distribution. This is my donation back to the gaming community.

I warn you now that getting the sphere of water to work correctly is a BITCH. I don't know
how to re-compile this map and get them to work again. I'd love to know if you figure out
how, though.
