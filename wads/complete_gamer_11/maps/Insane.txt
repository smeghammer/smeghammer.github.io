Description             : insane idiits
                          
                          This is my first Quake2 map so take care of
                          your critic.
                          Made it with QuArK 4.07 and QuArK 5a3 alpha
                          and i think that's a great editor!
                          I was lissening to Marilyn Manson, nine inch
                          nails, underworld, Pet Shop Boys DISCO2
                          remix CD and some Ministry when I did the level.
                          Ok, now you know that. what else should i
                          say...

* Leagal (shit) *

Ok lets start...

- "You may NOT use this level as a base to other levels and NOT
   play it on comercial servers without my permision and NOT
   put this level on any CD and NOT, and NOT, and NOT... bla, bla...

   Why write something you already know? In a little shorter
   way to say this:

   Just play the level and do not use it at other ways!
