Description             : You have been dropped into a Strogg
			     	  stronghold and you must fight your 
			  	  way out of the base, through the 
				  cave with a watery pool,  up the mine
			  	  shafts, back into the base, and endure
				  a lung busting swim to the exit . If 
				  you dare return to the base instead of
				  exiting you will encounter more angry
				  Strogg.

				  This level is primarily a Single Player
			        level, but I believe it should or could
				  serve as a reasonable arena for fragging
				  other players.  The DM positions are 
			        there, as are the weapons and ammo, give 
				  it a go in Multiplayer and see how it 
				  runs.

exceptionally high rating.   http://www.planetquake.com/talon

Conan The Barbarian (aka Arnie) too seriously :)
