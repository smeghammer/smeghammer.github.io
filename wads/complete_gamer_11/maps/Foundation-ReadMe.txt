Misc. Author Info       : This is my first attempt to create a level of any sort for any game.  I have used JED for Jedi Knight in the past, but didn't spend much time with it at all.  Also I seem to remember some blank stares at Quake Editing...Hm.  Basically, Its my first time and I hope to get feedback on Foundation, in order to further my attempts at level design for Unreal

Description             : Well, let's just say its a temple of sorts.  It started out rather small and grew to huge proportions.  I almost just chucked it, but decided since its early in the UnrealEd thing, why not release it anyway. Who knows? Maybe someone will learn from it, or it might even get popular...either way, enjoy it. (The waterfall is my favorite part of it)

Recommended Players     : Its kinda big, so start with at least 6 in my opinion, but Capps suggested 10-20 is good in there.  I played more than a few bot games with 5 bots and it played quite well, with a sizable number of kills.

Designed on             : Pentium 200 MMX, 64MB RAM, Voodoo Accelerator, and a 9.6 GB HD (although that probably doesn't matter much.)

Playtested By           : Myself and Capps on my 200 MMX and his P2 266 mhz machine.  Framerate was pretty good, although its size kinda slams it sometimes.

Additional Credits to   : All the creators of Unrealed, PlanetUnreal.com, UnrealEd.com, Brian 	Lozier, Rob Fuller II, and all the Jedis out there, but most of all my wife and my best buddy Capps.

* Construction *

Base                    :  Level from scratch

Editor(s) used          :  UnrealEd Beta (is there another?)

Known Bugs              :  Some textural errors, some misalignment of surfaces, although most turned out quite well...in other words, no "Hall of Mirrors" that I could find. Also, it gives a scripting error for Warpthingys, but it doesn't affect the level at all.  Damn those navigation points!

Some Thoughts           :  First don't blow away everything in sight...if you do, you may not be able to reach some weapons...and yes, you can reach everything in this level. Although it might take a little ingenuity =)

Neat Stuff of Interest? :  The teleporters work pretty well, if I do say so myself.  I prefer them over ports.  Much easier to make and the effect is quite nice. The waterfall, I'm not sure how it came out looking so good, but oh well, I love it.
