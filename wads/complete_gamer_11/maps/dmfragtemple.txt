Time Spent:	1 week
Single Player:	No
Deathmatch:	Yes 2-6 players
Bot Support (path nodes): Fully Implemented

Notes:	This level was designed on a P2-333/64mb ram, Monster 3D. I tried to optimize it as
much as possible using zoning techniques as discussed by Tim Sweeney.

Thanks to Debacle for explaining how to implement path nodes.

Anyone has my permission to use this level, as long as credit is given to me.

Any suggestions are welcome...
