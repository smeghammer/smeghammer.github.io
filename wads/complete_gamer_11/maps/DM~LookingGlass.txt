================================================================

Notes: This level started as a demonstration of kewl things that can be done with portals, but I decided to complete it.  The main battle rooms are connected via a portal on their ceilings.  

Everything in the other battle room will appear to be upside-down, but if you clip out of the map and look, you can see that it isn't.  Ray-traced projectiles (ASMD Regular fire, rifle bullets, Minigun, and the AutoMag) will NOT travel through portals.  Rockets, grenades, and other non-instantaneous weapons can be fired through it, though.  This is standard for ALL Unreal portals, so don't complain to me about it.  In addition, Bots will not "see" you through the portals...

The map contains all weapons except the minigun.  The layout is designed for the fast-and-furious, in-your-face slaughterhouse style of Deathmatch, however, it could also be used for a slower-paced, wandering match.


Editing Notes: Portals have to be the same size, but that's the only restriction on them.  You don't have to put them in the same orientation, and this level is only one of the many ways you can twist space to make interesting levels.
