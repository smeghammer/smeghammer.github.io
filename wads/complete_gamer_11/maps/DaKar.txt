Description:	This is my first ever release level, and the first map i've even done since Doom.
		This should play best with 4-10 players. I hope it runs well, it runs fine on my p2 233 in both software and 3dfx.

Installing:	Extract the .unr file to your Unreal\Maps directory or if you have one a User Maps directory.

Story: 		Not much since its a DM map. :) 
		Lin'Da'Kar(who looks exactly like the Lightning godess<g>) is the godess of Fire.
		This level will go along the same theme as my Upcoming single player level, based around the Fire godess.
		
Notes:		Any feedback is welcome. This is my first map and will be in a sort of ongoing beta. I'll revise add, change etc. as needed.	
		I'll add the pathnodes(or whatever) for bots later, they dont do too bad as of now however
		Text files suck, when i get more time i'll make a readme.htm. :)
		Editing in 800X600 on a 14" monitor sucks, but Unrealed makes it worth it.
		Eat your vegetables...

*Disclamer*
Please dont reproduce, sell, rip, modify and rerelease, blatantly steal stuff from my level, or do anything like that. You can put it on your UnrealServer if you have one though.
