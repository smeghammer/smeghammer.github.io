================================================================

** NOTE: This is NOT original **

I used the map DmMorbias from Unreal.  I liked this map a lot,
but after playing for a while I discovered a downfall,the
resources got used up too fast.  So instead of adding more
eightball launchers, I added some fast respauning AutoMags and
even faster clips.  I also added Nali healing plants and a few
surprises.
