Known bugs              : Only strange thing i noticed is that out
                          of eight playerstarts, only one seems to
                          be used. Hopefully nobody will camp there.
                          Maybe someone could figure out why the other
                          playerstarts are'nt used. But then i only tested
                          this map with bots.

Installation:             Just unzip the DmTown1.unr file to your 
                          Unreal\Maps dir. Then start a multiplayer game
                          and select the map from the list of dm maps.
                          Another way to load the map is to start a multi
                          game on another map, then press the ~ key to open
                          the console (or tab key) and enter the following:
                          open DmTown1    I noticed that some usermaps crash
                          If i start the game with them, but it will load 
                          if you first start with another map (like dmtundra)
                          or whatever, and use the open command. So if any
                          problem running this map, just use the open command.


Extended description: Spent alot of time alighning textures and ect on this
--------------------  map. Also, i found the levitational platforms to be 
                      fun to jump on. They are fast hehe. I did some pathnodes
                      for bots too. Some of the lifts are kinda hidden, but
                      can be found if you look all around the buildings outside
                      ledges and ect.
                    

Author's Notes        Hope ya find this map to be fun!
