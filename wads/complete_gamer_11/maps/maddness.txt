This is my first Unreal level (as you can clearly see)

NOTICE: I don't take any responsibility if player hurts his feelings playing this level. 

If you looking for level to shoot million of baddies, this propably ain't your thing. But anyways: Have fun :)

Level name..............Maddness
Single Play.............Yes?!?
DeathMatch..............Njet!
DarkMatch...............Nope
Co-Op...................Nope
Construction time.......5 days from scratch. (wery lazy work, and I learned UnrealEd in the process)
Known bugs..............Lots, If you kill the Nali, smoke just keep comin, some problems in map geometry, etc...

To play this 'masterpiece' just unzip to temp dir and copy files: madtexture.utx to \unreal\textures, maddness.unr to \unreal\maps and finally madsound.uax to \unreal\sounds

Then start unreal and write 'open maddness' in console
