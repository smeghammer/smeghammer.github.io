Credits :Special thanks to Id Software.	Quake 2 rules !
         Thanks to Ben and Valve Software for Worldcraft, and all the websites that 
         review Quake 2 maps ( except the ones that ignore mine )   
			 
Thanks to my beta testers: Shaku, Dick Delicious, the guys at Voo2Quake: Chank and Renegade,
and the folks at Froglabs who run the best custom map server on the net.
Check them out at www.froglabs.com - you may see this map there.

Unzip the bsp file to your Quake2/baseq2/maps folder. Start Quake 2 multiplayer,
and type "map homers11" (without the quotation marks) from the console to start play. 
 
Special note: clip brushes are everywhere so you won't get stuck on walls at all-Guaranteed !
lots of cool eyecandy, but r_speeds came out good overall. Tons of weapons and ammo
so you don't spend all your time looking for it. This map is set in the palace texture
theme. Frag !
