Description             : A single player map for Quake 2,

Testers                 : Per 'Ellusion' Nyhaug, Dark Monkey
                          Thanks men.

Extra info              : I started with BSP, but switched to QedRadiant early in
                          development. Why? BSP is slow with bigger maps.
                          Radiant has excellent region support and it works similar
                          to BSP, so the switch was easily made (it's also free).

Thanks to               : ID, for Quake2 [the best game ever] and Qed.
                          Robert A. Duffy, for excellent QedRadiant support.
                          You, for actually reading this and playing my level!

Plot (do we need one?)  : 

The story so far:
-----------------
  The Strogg have made a big mistake. Intelligence reports that a disc containing
essential data needed for our main campain is being held in a small Strogg
Outpost. We managed to make a duplicate key pass which can be used to open the
front door. A strike team consisting of five of our finest men has been dropped
near the Strogg Outpost... They have not reported back.
  We do not want to send in another team as the Strogg are alerted. But,
one man can sneak in and save this mission. You are that man.

   Your mission objectives:
   ------------------------
1) Locate the strike team.
2) Take command of the team and -if present- retrieve the pass from the
   team captain.
3) Enter the outpost and locate the data disc. 
4) Exit the base via the back door and rendevous with the strike team escape pod
   lying somewhere north of the base.
   It probably has been located by the Strogg, so look out.

   Good luck. We know you can do it.
