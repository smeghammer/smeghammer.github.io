Known Bugs      : There is one place in the level where an error message
                  may pop up, though it rarely happens. It happens when some func 
                  explosives go off "sz_getspace: overflow".  It does not affect
                  any mechanics of the level or gameplay, just pops up.  If you 
                  know what this is please let me know!  If you find any let me know.

Comments from author: This is my first attempt at a Quake 2 level so nothing fancy, but
I tried to make it fun.  Let me know what you think.  I'm currently working on my next
project, a 2 or maybe 3 level (separate levels) mini-series called BIOTECHNICAL WARFARE.
Watch out for it and grab that enviro suit . . .
