You may distribute this level and include it in any deathmatch compilation
etc., as long as you: 

1. Include this text file untouched and give me credit.

^-- I stole this verbage from Sten Uusvali.  Creator of 'ztn2dm1.bsp',
otherwise known as "Painkiller", a q2 deathmatch level I really admire.
I didn't have a .TXT template.. so I stole it from him.  Sorry.

Thanks
Ben Caston
