Description for Unreal.org DM maps section: Sequel to DMPonikus, this one is total anarchy!

Next map in the DMPonikus series, this is my second Unreal DM map and, unlike the first map, this one started from the very beginning with the intentions of being a DM map. I concentrated more on architecture in this one, as well as keeping the map as a whole more flat to increase the amount of anarchy and to make it easier for Bots to move around. Total anarchy with 8 bots, and, although I haven't tried it with real players yet, I'd expect around 4 guys to be about right.
