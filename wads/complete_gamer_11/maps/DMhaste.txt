Description             : I wanted to make a very cool dm map

			  games. I was bored with a ton of the 
			  levels that are out as of right now,
			  and I wanted to change that :).

Where to get this map   : ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/pub/unreal/maps
Other levels by author  : None as of now.

Author's Notes
--------------
Me and my brother (hazeus - clan31337/#clan31337) both started 
working with UnrealEd as soon as we got it working, because we 
knew of easy and simple it was to make maps. You don't have to 
be some genius to make these maps, but, making GOOD playing maps
is a lot harder. If you would like to try my bro's map as well, 
you can go to my page located at the top, or you can go ftpsearch 
the file DMLastPyramid.zip.
