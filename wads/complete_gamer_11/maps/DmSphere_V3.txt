Description:

Basically a two level map that takes advantage of Unreal's awesome lighting abilities.  Plays vey well against both Bots and human opponents.  Weapons are placed throughout level and going for either the Kevlar Suit or SuperHelath could be tricky.  Plays well wtih up to 12 people or Bots....


Enjoy....
