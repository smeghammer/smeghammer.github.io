Directions          : Just put the map into your Maps (or UserMaps directory).
                      Then double click or open from the console
                      ('open PaNunu' or 'open ..\UserMaps\PaNunu')

Notes               : This is my first map, unless you count the recreation of
                      my apartment in Worldcraft in the early days of Quake :)
                      This is also my entry into Myscha the Sled Dog's Level
                      Design Charette (July '98). I'll let you know how well it
                      does!
                      
                      I'm planning on rereleasing this map at some point in
                      time as it's my hope to make a series of maps based on
                      this one. In addition to the addition of teleporters
                      between maps, I really want to fix the end of this map.
                      Without a working 3D modeller, the ending is a bit of a
                      hack. Although the node/poly counts still fit into the
                      contest rules, it's slower than it needs to be and I
                      intend to fix this eventually.
                      
                      Please fill out the feedback form that accompanies this
                      level! If you liked it, please let me know where it was
                      good and not so good. If you hated it, let me know so I
                      don't keep producing crap ;)
