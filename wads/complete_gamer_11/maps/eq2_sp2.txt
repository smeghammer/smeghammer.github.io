Description             : Single-Player Quake 2 Map.
                          Killing more Strogg.  There's a hint of oddity when you
			  reach the Stogg research wing :)
			  It's a little short, but I just don't have the time to
			  do any more work on it - I'm off to do level design for
			  a new 3d shooter at Cyclone Studios/3do.
