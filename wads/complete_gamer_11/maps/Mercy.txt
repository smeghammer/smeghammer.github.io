Play information: Quake2 map; MERCY


This is a MERCY mission. STROGGOS is gone, but the Penal Colony DETEN3 holds 50 POW's that are being
tortured/interrogated.  They are beyond any hope of medical attention - the best we can do is end
their pain.  As such, you will sent on a mission of mercy - to kill all of your captured
mates and end their pain.  They have managed to secrete about their persons various items that you
will find helpfull in your quest - weapons and ammo and such - so take care in ensuring 100% kills in
this mission. Good luck.



THIS IS MY FIRST QUAKE MAP AND AS SUCH HAD QUITE A FEW MISTAKES/LEARNING ADJUSTMENTS. I'VE CORRECTED
THE MORE BLATANT ONES AND WORKED AROUND A FEW OTHERS. THERE ARE A COUPLE OF PROBLEMS WITH FUNC_AREAPORTALS
THAT I'VE YET TO SEE ADDRESSED BY ANONE ELSE SO I WILL MENTION IT HERE.  DO NOT PUT A DOOR/PORTAL
RIGHT NEXT TO A WINDOW ( TRANS 33/66 ) !  TRY IT AND SEE WHAT I MEAN - YOU GET A HALL OF MIRROR ABOUT 50%
OF THE TIME DEPENDING ON TIMING AND YOUR ACTUALL VIEW THROUGH THE PORTAL - DON'T KNOW IF IT VIS OR RAD THAT
HAS THE PROBLEM OR JUST THE QUAKE ENGINE INTERPRETATION OF THE BSP BUT IT'S DEFENITELY THERE. ALSO, ITS MORE 
THAN HARD TO TRY AND GET THE AREA PORTAL TO NOT ERROR OUT WHEN YOU HAVE VARIOUS ARCHES AND ROOMS
IMMEDIATELY ADJECENT TO YOUR DOOR. FOR INSTANCE - PUT A NORMAL DOOR AND FUNC_AREAPORTAL THEN ANGLE THE
HALLWAY ITS ENCLOSED IN AND ADD A BUNCH OF OTHER BRUSHES AROUND IT AND HAVE IT COME INTO A WEIRD SIZED
ROOM - NOW TRY TO ADJUST THE AREA PORTAL OUTSIDE THE DOOR - UP AND DOWN ETC TO FIND OUT WHERE ITS 
SUPPOSE TO BE TO BLOCK VIS FROM SEEING INTO THE OTHER ROOM ! YIKES - ITS ROUGH DEPENDING ON THE COMPLEXITY
OF THE BRUSHES SURROUNDING YOUR DOOR/FRAME ETC.  ANYWAY, MY NEXT 2 HUB LEVELS WILL BE CORRESPONDINGLY
BETTER - BET ON IT !  I'VE LEARNED ENOUGH TO BE DANGEROUS.  ALSO, R_SPEEDS ARE ABOUT 800 AS YOU ENTER THE
BIG ROOM - CHOPPED ENOUGH STUFF OUT OF IT ALREADY, SORRY.   AGAIN, I'LL KNOW BETTER NEXT TIME !



Final Note :  This is being released as a Single Level but was designed with a hub in mind - I modified the 
change Levels to teleport you to the proper spot that you returned to. Don't think I'm going to be able
to finish the 2 jail levels since I'm now working on a new project. Have Fun !

Construction:

Worldcraft v1.5 registered until I needed to implement help, goals, lightramp, animated texture's etc.
which was pretty quick; so I finished with QERadiant; a VERY GOOD EDITOR ! Take note.

I'd love to see these 2 merged !  - after having used Radiant for a while I've come to appreciate it 
more and more - besides, Robert Duffy seems just as adept as Ben Morris ( Worldcraft ) 
at increasing functionality/speed while tightening everything else up. Keep up the GREAT work both of you !
