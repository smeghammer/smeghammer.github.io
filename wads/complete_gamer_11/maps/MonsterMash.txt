Description             : This map exists for two reasons:

                          a) It allows weapon designers and their users to play around
                             with their new toys.
                          b) It's loads of fun watching the monsters beat each other up :)

                          Basically, you're standing on a ledge over a pit. You have many
                          buttons available to call up different monsters and affect their
                          behaviour.

                          Note: this is not a real Single Player map per se; rather it's meant
                                as either a fun toy to mess around with or as a testbed
                                for serious designers.

                          Quick guide to having fun: press all creature buttons in the first
                          row. Use the cheats GOD, FLY, INVISIBLE 1 to position yourself in
                          a corner under the ceiling. Using the rifle, zoom in a bit.
                          Watch...

Installation
------------

Unzip the file, place it anywhere, double-click on it. Simple.

Extended description:
--------------------

Okay, you start out in the mirror room, where you can check out what your player and weapon
model looks like. You walk out, collecting all the weapons (the cheat ALLAMMO comes useful
at the very end). 

You're now on a ledge overlooking The Pit. 
Two elevators are available: one leads down to a room with a one-way wall, allowing you to view the pit close-up without being seen. The other one leads up to the walkway so you can view the
happenings from above. 

Note that you're protected behind an invisible wall on the ledge - meaning the monsters can't
see you unless you take the elevator up to the walkway. 
If you fall into the pit, you can take the elevator in the corner to get back up (it can only
be triggered by you, thus the monsters won't suddenly appear up there).
All elevators are silent, to avoid disturbing your creatures.

The creatures can be called up with the buttons on the ledge. Each button will cause the
corresponding creature to appear in the pit. A maximum of two creatures (only one Titan,
though) are called up, and new ones automatically appear if one is killed.
From left to right:

Cow (won't be attacked by normal monsters)
Gasbag (flying, can see you even if you're invisible)
Titan (in a very bad mood, will start beating up the others very soon)
Krall (Elite version)
Brute
Skaarj Warrior
Skaarj Trooper
Nali (cheese others off, will be attacked sooner or later).

You'll also find two special Nali buttons:
Skull Nali: A bunch of Nalis appears. Great for target practice.
Fire Nali: A Nali will drop onto the moving platform on the back wall (moving target).

Finally, another two buttons can be found:
Fireball: drops many grenades into the pit from above. Great for upsetting creatures.
Apple Nali: makes all Nalis friendly (except the ones you shot).

PS: Down with The Nali Freedom Foundation! Go and nuke the bastards!


Author's Notes
--------------

The ThingFactory has a few irritating shortcomings. Currently, I can't edit scripts, but as
soon as it's possible, I will bring out a better version, which allows you better control
over the number of creatures called up. If enough people are interested, I'll add the other 
creatures as well (Queen, anyone?).

Note that the Nalis run out after a while: a Nali who disappears via meditation will not
cause the CreatureFactors to trigger :(
