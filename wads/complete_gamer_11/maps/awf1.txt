The Story:
--------------------------------------------------------------
Incoming Comm - USMC Command:

Soldier, we've located strong fussion signatures on long range scans of
the Acheron planetoid in wide orbit around Strogos. Satellite probes have
obtained images of a Strog reactor built into the rock, and we have reason to 
believe that this facility is a new arms manufacturing plant. We suspect the 
Strog have developed a new technique for production of fussion based weapons.
If we don't discover their plans and disable the facility, we may soon
be facing hordes of BFG10k wielding infantry. 

We're pressed hard on the front lines, so we're sending you back in. You've
got to destroy the reactor and if possible get the data on the fussion 
reactor. 

Phase one of the mission requires you to infiltrate the main lab through
a maintenance tunnel we've located. This tunnel is 
little-used, and should lead you through the upper security station, where you'll be
able to take out the sentries, hopefully before they alert the entire
base guard. It's going to be hairy soldier, so stay on your toes. We wish you luck. 

USMC Command out.

*background of this map*
This is the first map I've actually released. I learned alot from it, as it basically started
out as an exercise in Q2 entities. There are some speed issues, but my system is fairly 
powerful, so it may be slower on your PC. If so, sorry about that. I've done as much as I can
with the map to optimize it, but the truth is that I never envisioned the map actually
being released; I had to force alot of the optimization, so it's less than perfect. 
The second map in the series will be much quicker, I promise! Other issues: I run 3dFX GL so
I have absolutely no idea what the map looks like without colored lighting... sorry about that, 
software guys... Also, the exit is set to send you to the map "awf2". This isn't out yet,
but when it comes out I want the maps to link together.
This is the first of a 3-level unit, so look for the other two levels in the coming months. 
I'll release the entire unit in a pack file when it's 100% complete. Have fun, and
drop me an email if you want to comment/praise/curse my foul map :)
