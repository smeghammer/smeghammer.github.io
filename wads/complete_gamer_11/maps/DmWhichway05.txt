Description:	A large arean-like area with a criss-crossed catwalk overhead. 4 portals
standing in the center of the arena lead to 4 portals that enter onto the catwalks. A lift
takes players up to a deadly hallway, and leads to a large drop-chute that lands the player
on the main floor in a pool of water, leaving the player totally unharmed. Many sniper
points, defendable rooms, and a decent amount of nali fruit lying around. 

Installing:	Just unzip into you're Unreal/Maps dir and play.

Story:	  No story, just play with about 4-5 others or more, bots work fine.

Notes:	  The hallway at the top of the lift is rather deadly because of the rifle and the
armor that sit up there, but bailing out of the hallway is rather fun. The randomness of
loose fire roaming the level is fun due to the portals and adds a lot of excitement.
