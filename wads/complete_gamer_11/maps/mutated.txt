Map description         : Uhm.. my fourth small Quake 2 map for Single Play 
                          and first for DeathMatch / Co-op Play.

Blahs                   : This one's made for "Best Of The Net" Level Design Contest 
                          and that's why it bears so much resemblance to id's original 
                          Quake 2 levels. I had fun while imitating id's levels and adding
                          some of my own. I hope you have just as much fun while playing.
                          
                          This map is made in gamma level 2 and *I* think it looks best in
                          that brightness. Of course, if you don't like it, change it appropriately.

                          As always, feedbacks are welcomed. Especially if anyone plays DM or Co-op with
                          this map, I'll be appreciated if he could send me some demo of it. As this was
                          my first planned-before-making level, I think it has much more inter-connected
                          structures than my previous levels. Well, you're the judge. :)
