Well I have finished this map now, it was going to be just a simple small Net DM level, but it has grown a wee bit, hehehe. ;)

It is still just a small/compact level, and very simple in design, but it rocks, wooo. ;))

Just Unzip into your Unreal folder, and everything will be unpacked into the right folders.
