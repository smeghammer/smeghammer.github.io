Author's Notes
--------------
This is a difficult level in more ways than one 
You may need some scratch paper to figure out the puzzle without dying
	It's been a month since Doc awakened in a fleabag
hotel on the planet 11081, a backwater planet with only a number
for a name. On the hotel night stand he found his credit card, with
only enough credit to last a few days, and a set of documents
explaining what he was doing there. A legal document explained
that Doc had agreed to a mind-block of all memories of his 
employment with the Inuit corporation in the event of a breach
of contract....

	Doc stowed away in the cargo hold of a ship. He wanted to 
be anywhere but 11081.....

	While onboard the ship it is invaded by the Skaarj. Little
did they know Doc was on board. The desparate Doc  fought
his way through his ship and freed the crew. He soon met the owner
of the ship a strange alien who would soon become his benefactor
	His benefactor had a mission for him that would set him 
up for life with all the wealth he could stand. Doc had nothing to
lose since he had nothing at all. He accepted the mission.....

	The mission involved Doc's former employer. Who was conducting
a secret project on a planet on the edge of known space. His benefactor 
had interceptedan FTL transmission from one of Inuits new secret 
stealth S-38's engaged in that mission. It seems it had been shot down.
 All doc had to do was find the ship and salvage a backup memory core
 from it's computer and rendevou at a pickup point. 
Simple huh

This level, "MoreReal", is just one of the 
Maps of  Doc's encounters On Nali

One of the Nali priests has hidden himself in a puzzle keep.
The puzzle keeps were built by the monks of haute to hide  valuable
artifacts from the prophecied return of the Skaarj.

You must solve the puzzle and get to the priest before the Skaarj
can catch and kill him.

Good Luck
