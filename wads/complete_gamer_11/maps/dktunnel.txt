Welp here is my second map for Darkmatch. No Complex Architecture or kick ass Unreal effects like Mirrors
or portals. Just basic narrow hallways for your enjoyment. This map isn't the best thing in
the world but I am having *ALOT* of fun playing with bots, so try it out and please don't
bitch and complain for not being Epic like. This map is not a beta.

No one can reproduce this level or something, or I will be forced to open up a can of serious 
w00p ass...biatch.
