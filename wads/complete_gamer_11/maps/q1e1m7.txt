* Other Info *

Q2E1M7 is only for deathmatch, so I removed the lightning installation
of the original and the path to the exit, wich is never used in deathmatch.
I changed one super nailgun into a chaingun and the other into a machinegun
There is no hyper blaster because then I would have to put another
type of ammo in the level. The grenade launcher near the start of the
level is now a railgun, but you'll have to do it with the 10 slugs that come
with the railgun, there is no ammo for it.
Enjoy the level, and mail me your opinion.
