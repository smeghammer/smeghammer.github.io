The Story:
--------------------------------------------------------------
Following our successful assassination of the Strog leader and
destruction of their primary defenses, 
civil unrest has caused the Strog to begin seperating into tribal
factions in support of various candidates for the title of Makron.
One such candidate, a savage baron in control of the Zion Sector
on Strogos, has recently united the Strog lords in the surrounding 
territories, and we fear he may have the resources neccessary to 
obtain the throne as the new Makron. If this happens, the reunited
enemy will once again set their sights upon Earth. We cannot let this
happen marine.

Strike team Alpha dropped 2 days ago, but lost commlink sometime this morning, 
apparently in the vicinity of the baron's personal compound. We fear the worst.
Their mission was a search and destroy order on the baron himself. 
We need you to go in, find the strike team, and assist any survivors 
in carrying out these orders. If they have all been lost, you are to 
continue alone. If the baron survives, we will once again be targets
of the entire Strog empire. We're counting on you. Godspeed marine.

*background of this map*
I created this map as an entry in the QERadiant map contest of March '98. I think this is MUCH 
better than my first released map, AWF1. I'd appreciate any and all comments, suggestions, or
criticisms of the map. Also, if you play coop, let me know how it is, as I've not tested it's 
coop capabilities. I have played the map DM using bots, and have removed all puzzle doors, 
replaced powerups in secret areas with DM-appropriate items, and fleshed out the weapons available on the
map. Have fun!
