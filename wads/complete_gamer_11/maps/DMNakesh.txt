Description             : Deathmatch level for Unreal. After getting
			used to the level editor I decided to sit
			down and work on a Deatmatch level or two
			before working on my single player levels. 
			This level is fairly symetrical and all of the
			weapons and most of the goodies on it. It is
			designed with bloodshed in mind but is not too
			small. Should fit up to four comfortably.
			It is nicely designed but sparese on textures.
                                                                              
Additional Credits to   : Epic Megagames for an absolutely wonderful
			game and level editor! Thank you!
