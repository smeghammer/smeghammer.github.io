Description             : Some time ago, a chap called Mark. K. Gresbach Jr. created
			        a map for DOOM I, calling it LEDGES. It became rather
		   	        famous rather quickly - not because of its textures (which
                          were not terribly hot) but because of its brilliant layout.
			        One of ids map designers called it his very favourite private
                          DM level - high praise indeed.

                          I ported it straight to Quake II, but found the play to be
                          rather slow (the big arena in the middle asked too much of the
                          Quake engine). Anybody interested anyway can look for 
                          'Quaking Ledges'.

                          Now I ported it to Unreal, and it plays like a dream - 
                          especially the Razorjack is rather lethal...

New in this version     : I received quite a bit of feedback, and thus the following has 
                          been changed in this map:
                          
                          * Bot PathNodes - BotMatch in this map is great fun :)
                          * SkyBox added (how embarassing to forget this)
                          * Better lava and slime animations, prettyfied the lavapool
                          * In software mode, the hidden items showed through the doors - fixed.
                          * Invisibility removed (too much paranoia for you?) and weapon 
                            placement slightly changed.
                          * Some minor texture problem fixed (yes, I'm a texture perfectionist).
                          * Adopted standard Unreal description template 
                            (much recommended, guys!)

                          Things that won't change and why:

                          * Lightsources: the rooms are already rather cramped, and the 
                            additional brushes would only slow the engine down. This is a pure
                            DM map, after all.

Installation
------------

Well, as usual, really. May I suggest not cluttering up your UNREAL\MAPS directory itself?
Instead, edit UNREAL\SYSTEM\UNREAL.INI, and add your very own map directory into the 
[Core.System].Paths description. Much neater.

As the filename is 'DMLedgesv2', you can easily select it from within the game itself.

Extended description:
--------------------
This is *the* all-time great DM map - a pity I didn't think up the layout
myself, but I kept as close to the original as possible. I purposefully
kept everything very simple, leaving out lamps and the like because this
level has to play as fast as possible.

Ladies and Gentlemen, this level shows you history: for example, the lava
pit was originally used to suicide - in the times before suiciding cost
you frags :)

About UnrealEd Beta: Ugh, this program is responsible for more screams
of rage per minute than Windoze95, and that's not a compliment. Vertex
editing is chock full of bugs, and I draw my hat and bow before Epics
level designers, who had to use this concoction for all their maps.
And I kick the behind of the UnrealEd programmer. Hard. (Okay, it's Beta.
But still.)

Author's Notes

I'm extremely interested in feedback. Please email me with any ideas, suggestions,

like to hear from you.
