Title                   : Cray Oh La Boxes
Filename                : craybox.bsp
Date of Release         : Jan 20th, 1998 (11 months after CY2A)

Description             : Really fun deathmatch level for three
                          to eight players.  Quake 2 only!
                          Two players will have some, er, quiet
                          time, shall we say.
Problems                : None that I know of.  Not as pretty as
                          I'd like, and some clunky things were
                          added to fix too many visible polys or
                          edges or something.  That also caused
                          me to take out a cool teleporter and
                          secret place.  Ah, well.

History
----------------------------------------------------------------
We were porting Anachronox over to Quake 2, and I wanted to be
able to talk with the level designers more fluently, and to see
what Quake 2 could do.  I didn't explore everything, but I got
a little taste of the power.  I look forward to trying more
stuff in the next level.
   About the name--Squirrel picked on the computer in the main
room, saying it looked like a Semi, so I was going to call it
[Something] Semicomputer, but he also picked on most people's
Quake 2 levels, including mine, for being too colorful.  So
instead of fixing it, I named it Crayola Boxes, which is also
a pun, because there's a computer (could be a Cray) in the main
room with boxes around it.  I spelled it like that so it can
go everywhere without some stupid megacorporation making me
change the name.  Also, I say "La" a lot in email and ICQ and
IRC and CU See Me.
   Thanks to everyone that tested it (basically Team Anachronox
and Bill Nadalini), and thanks especially to Cleaner, Rich, and
Larry for their help with design and editing and map bug fixes
and BSP workarounds.
   BTW, I think this looks _okay_ and frame rate is a little
slow, but it exists, which is cool.  Next one will be pretty
and fast...

HINTS ON CRAYBOX
Here are some tips on getting around Cray Oh La Boxes. Don't
read this if you want to figure stuff out by yourself!
==Main Computer Room
  You can jump from the railing above the rocket launcher hole
  onto the crates.  You can also just walk onto the shelf
  behind the boxes.  Did you see the armor and health
  underneath the ramp, too?  Hope so.  I always go there....
  Rocket launcher, armor....

  You can climb on either side of ladders, but only the tall
  one is a hiding spot.

  You can get to all the window ledges.  Everyone wants the
  cool armor and the rockets--shoot them as they go for the
  goodies.

  You can use the computer (that big block of beigeness)
  to get to the grenade launcher, the outside area, or
  straight through the window above.  Oh yeah, and there's a
  freakin' megahealth on it!  Go!
      And if you have trouble jumping from the grenade launcher
  platform to the computer, jump onto the lights, and then up
  on top of the computer.

  You can hop from the ladder/teleporter area to the ducts.

  You can sneak through the little window to the outside.

  If there's a ledge, you can hop to it somehow.

==Lower Computer Room
  Know where that extra health is behind the computer.

  Going down and going around the computers and taking
  an unexpected way out can lose people pretty easy.

==Outside Grass Area
  You can hop between all the ledges on the support beams.

  The platform will squish you!  Watch it!

  You can sneak through the little window.

  You can hop to the beam then WALK to the Railgun.

==Dark Lava Pit Room
  You can easily hop to the machine gun on the Lava Heat Vent.

  The Lava Frogs comment is by the teleporter in the lava.
  It was in Corpseyard II and is sorta my sig, though not
  of brushes.  I guess it is my Hitchcock appearance or
  something.

==Central Catwalk Lava Death Room
  The corners are ladders!

  You can hop on the bottom of the pipe, onto the little
  shelf and back on a path.

  You found the Invulnerability, right?

  If you hear someone lava-screaming and you are near, run here
  and start firing--they'll probably be climbing the corners
  and REALLY vulnerable.  Heh heh.

==North Secret Shiny Room
  You can sneak into the room with the glowing yellow
  machines in it.  Hopping over, you can get to a ladder
  that gets you to rockets and cells.  Falling off early
  gets you health and a hiding place.

  You can TRY to hide on the back of the ladder in the main
  room....

==Secret BFG Room
   Crouch to get the BFG obviously.  Go on the outside so
   people running by don't see you.


STANDARD TECHNIQUES
You can run across 64-wide gaps, like from the crates to the
shelf.  You will get around a LOT faster if you don't have to
jump.  Also, if you jump before plummeting in certain places,
you will get hurt, while you won't if you just run off.

Later!   --Tom

P.S. Anachronox is going to be reaaaaaaally cool.  I can't wait!
