Description             : Based on the "lost level of id" 
                          DM7 - "Acrophobia". This is a Quake 2 
	                  version of DM7 and not strictly a straight 
                          conversion.

			  (Shrike) for testing, ideas and bugging the 
			  hell out of me to get it done.

* Construction *

Base                    : Built completely from scratch
Editor(s) used          : GLQoole 2.31
Modifications made      : Quake 2'd it, made a few structural changes 
			  from the original to extend playability (I 
			  hope).
Known Bugs              : Theres a visual glitch that only shows up
 			  when running Quake2 in software mode, it doesn't
			  appear if you are running GL. It appears to be a
			  problem with the Quake software renderer as I've 
			  seen the same problem in other peoples levels.
Build Time              : Too long due to intervening bouts of excessive 
			  drinking.
