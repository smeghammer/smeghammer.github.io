Thanks to Dark Dante(http://www.geocities.com/TimesSquare/Fortress/9324) for the rotolift prefab.

Thanks to Captain DynaBaul and Lt.Dan (http://www.planetquake.com/lt.dan) and Myrstyn for
beta testing. This is a medium size level with vertical and arena-style play. The level connects
well overall with no back tracking necessary to get around. The design was kept basic, using
no major structural enhancements, which improves playability. Great for team play or kill
anything that moves. Extract the bsp file to your Quake2\baseq2\maps folder. Start a multiplayer
game, and type- map homers20 -at the console to start fragging.
