Description          : Timebase Alpha is my second Quake 2 map. Designed for
                       single play (skill levels included) only.
                          
  The Story:  The Strogg are currently working on a device that could end life
             on Earth as we know it. A Time Portal Generator is their latest,
             and perhaps deadliest, means of attacking Earth. Your mission is
             simple,(hehe),shut the damn thing down ! Oh yeah, casualties have 
             been heavy lately, so you'll be going in alone. Saddle up, soldier,
             your pod leaves at 0400 ! Stop the Strogg before they stop you.....
             from being born !!!!!
