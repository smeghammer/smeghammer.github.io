Description             : This is a small episode, consisting of 2 maps.
                          Play it on 'hard' setting, that's the way I do it.

Story                   : Do we need one? oh well...
                          You have been assigned a mission to locate and
                          destroy a Strogg chemical factory.  The Strogg seem
                          to have found a way to make fuel from slime.  If they
                          manage to use this technology they will have infinite
                          fuel for their war machine!  They must not succeed!

                          Your mission:
                          Locate the factory, infiltate and stop it.
                          We have found the hangar the Strogg use to supply the
                          factory.  Get in, follow the supply route and stop
                          the pumps...  Good luck!
