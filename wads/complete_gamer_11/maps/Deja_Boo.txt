Description             : Single player level(s) for Quake 2 (my first map.)
Additional Credits to   : id Software, for Quake2 (has nearly made up for Quake1) 
                          The guys at Qoole (Great editor no matter what anyone else says)
			  Bad Monkey for the Prefabs (grdtower, and floor lever)

================================================================

----INSTALLATION----
Copy both .bsp files (deja.bsp, deja_2.bsp) 
into a subdirectory of quake2\baseq2 called maps.

(i.e. c:\quake2\baseq2\maps)

Then run quake2.

*Go into the console by pressing the key left of the 1 key (~),
and type in "map deja"

The .bsp extension should not be typed in, and neither the 
inverted commas.

::::::::::::::THE MISSION:::::::::::::::::

***Get some Intelligence.***

(For your superiors that is...)
The information is on a CD that you have to ask the strogg to give you.
If they refuse you may use force...


Good luck, Marine - you'll probably need it...

TIPS
____

SAVE the Invulnerability (if you find it) for the next level. 
It will help your encounter with da Bosses.

There is a platform that takes you up to the radar & the rocket-launcher but it is camuflaged.
It is set into operation by the shoot-button inside the control room

Comments                : You guessed it:
				
			  YOU NEED A 3DFX CARD TO FULLY ENJOY THIS...
				
			  I've tried to keep r-speeds down, but  
			  They get pretty high around the control room, and 
			  the gameplay SUFFERS GREATLY in software q2.
			  This is due to inexperience on my part.

			  I know a lot of things in this map are not perfect,
			  I've left it in this state for a very good reason:
		
				I AM TAKING THE UK BAR EXAMS!!!
				and it would be winderfull if I could pass. Thank You.
				(however I should point out that my exam stress
				did contribute to the inspiration for the level)
		

			Also note that this is my first map, and it is perhaps lacking 
			in the "perfect flow gamepley" area (to say the least).
			I promise that I will try to get better
			at this for the next one.

			If you have any hints or tips or suggestions please let me know...
			I can take it, and I can use it.

Known Bugs      : 	Where to begin...

			There are probably some bugs that I've overlooked,
		  	please e-mail me and point them out 

		1. The textures on the Glass Jar at the circle room with Boss2:	
		   For the life of me I just couldn't get the x-alignment right
		   so I gave up. If you know how to fix this e-mail me.

		2. The sides of the "teeth" of the door before the control area:
		   They are totally black because they are not being lit by anything.
		   This is because I used CSG cutting to create the grooves
		   and the teeth of the door fill them perfectly so no light can get in
		   I tried to give them the light tag & transluscency, but nothing worked 
		   If you know how to fix it please let me know.
		   (I couldn't shrink them because then I'd get a "splitface error")

		3. The game temporarilly hangs when the Tank Commander is killed:
	           This is because a number of entities are spawned at the same time.
		   Sorry. 
		   excuse: Inexperience

		4. This is a biggie..the glass floor in Deja (Part II) appears immediately, 
		   whereas it is not actually there; result: falling into the lava.
		   I tried every thing to get this right, I turned the floor into a train, 
		   a door, but nothing worked. 
		   If anyone knows why this occurs or how I can fix it tell me. 
		   Just lob a few grenades or wait to see if the sound has stopped to be sure that 
		   the floor has returned.

		4. The r_speeds around the control room are shameful:
		   I know, I know...leave me alone!

		If you spot anything else that isn't trivial then please let me know.	


THE DESIGN:
----------
I hate Dark depressing levels.
They remind me of Quake1 which is an experience
I wish to avoid remembering if I can help it.

Single Player levels are about inspiration, and originality; they should provide an
immersive environment for the player to PLAY through and ENJOY. 

This isn't artistic nonsense from someone that can't or won't play deathmatch games; 
I'm pretty good at deathmatch actually...
but I can testify that DM provides you with 1/10 of the feeling you get when you complete
your own level. That's the truth, honest.

I have tried to set the level in a "real" environment other than the "old abandoned base"
setting. there are too many levels you forget after 5 min you stopped playing them.

This level supposedly takes place at an army barracks. I wanted to get more recognisable areas in,
like a mess hall, or a garage with trucks, but the level got too big too quick.
Maybe next time.

I am not saying that my level IS inspiring or immersive or original. Far from it. 
it is flawed in certain important respects.
What I am saying is that those are my IDEALS.

The greatest compliment I aspire to get someday is "your level is different".
Till that day I shall keep trying.
