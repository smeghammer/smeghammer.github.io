Description             : Here is Armageddon 5, my first (and last) DM map
                          for Quake 2. It's inspired by DM3 of Quake and
                          JAIL3 of Quake 2.

                          There's so much I could tell you about this map,
                          like that this is my first Quake2 level and has a
                          lot of areas I would have done differently now,
                          how much more detail I would have liked to add,
                          how much architecture I had to reduce to keep the
                          framerate low, etc. pp. :)
                          Anyway, I hope you like this level and have some
                          great DMs in this map, it should be good for up to
                          24 players.
                          If you know of a server running this map please
                          tell me :)

                          I may release an update with changed item layout -
                          we (Clan Ocrana) have tested this level for quite a
                          while, but Q2 DM is still new and maybe there are a
                          few items that should be placed differently to make
                          thhis level play better.
                          Feel free to mail me your suggestions.

* Construction *

Base                    : new map
Build Time              : a few days + another few days for finding leaks
                          without pointfile (I can't run QE4) and trying to
                          keep reasonable r_speeds without any r_draworder
                          and r_drawflat commands - how stoned have you been
                          at id software when throwing those commands out? ;)
Editor(s) used          : BSP 0.87-0.89. No QE4, WC or Qoole can ever beat
                          that editor
Known Bugs              : one texture error because QBSP3 merges two faces
                          with different textures together - it is ok in
                          the .map file, but after a dozen attempts to get it
                          right in the .bsp as well I gave up.

* How to use this level *

Make a "maps" directory in ../quake2/baseq2 and copy the level into it.
In Quake2, bring up the console and type in "map arma5".

To start a deathmatch game either start it as usual and type "map arma5" in
the server's console or start a multiplayer server from Quake 2 and type
"map arma5" in the console.
