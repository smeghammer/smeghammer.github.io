Description             : A deathmatch level for 4-8 players... 1on1 might
                          get too slow. Use "weapons stay" DM flag to keep
                          the game fair...

                          Added more ammo and guns, fixed a texture 
                          alignment problem, added clip brushes to avoid 
                          getting stuck in some places.
