Other maps by author    : So far this is my first map(ok a revision of my
						  first map) but I plan to have more released one
						  day.

Description             : This is my first map for Quake2. This is actually
						  a map I made before and just redid it to make it
						  look a ton better. The original map was called
						  bugvile.bsp and was in bugvile.zip. I decided
						  some of the areas needed spicing up and noticed
						  that I had left out a few clip brushes here and
						  there so I decided to revise it. It is a dark
						  deathmatch map using black metals. Any complaints,
						  compliments, suggestions, tips, or whatever would
						  be greatly appreciated. The level design and 
						  architecture were all completely thought up by
						  me. I used only light fixtures to give off
						  light and no light entities. I did this to try
						  and create the most realistic lighting I could
						  achieve. Also a note on the lighting is that I
						  cannot see colored lighting so this was a blind
						  attempt to use it.
