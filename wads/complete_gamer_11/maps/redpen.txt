--------------------------------------------------------------
The plotline for this map is the following:
--------------------------------------------------------------

The USMC command central has got reports of captives held in imprisonment in a heavily fortified
Strogg installation called the "Red Penitentiary". Unfortunately, getting into this prison 
will be quite a challenge, as it's guarded also by several laser grids which must
be shut off before attempting to get inside.

You take on the responsibility to wipe out this secret penitentiary, relieve the imprisoned
inhabitants from their pain, and also find a way to shut the place down. Permanently.

Good luck!

*More background on making this map*

It's my very first try at a Q2 map. Although it may not be as 
"professional looking" as I would have liked, I think I've learned a lot.
I also had to learn two new editors in the process (QE4b and QERadiant).
Luckily these editors are truly great, so they were not too hard to learn, after
having used QuMa for classic Quake all my editing life. 

Actually, I remember I was very surprised and pleased when I first loaded up the 
original QE4 (from id) and found that it was remarkably similar to QuMa. IMO, the 
"Z-checker" system found in these editors is far more intuitive and productive 
than having all these cluttered 2D-views (as represented by, for instance, Worldcraft 
and Qoole). Nothing wrong said about those other editors, though :).

One last note about the map: I don't have a 3dfx card, so I really can't judge
the colored lighting used in this map. I'm sorry about this, so if the colored 
lighting sucks, I have a very strong reason. I guess this shouldn't matter too
much.

OK, enjoy and give me a comment if you like. Always nice getting some
feedback (thajohan@online.no).
