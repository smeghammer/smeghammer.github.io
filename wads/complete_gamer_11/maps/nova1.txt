Map Description         : My first map making attempt for any game, actually second but first 
                          wasnt released cuz the r_speeds ranged from 3000 - 7000 ;)
Story                   : 

The war against the Strogg has made quantam leaps toward the goal of total annihilation of their
vile pestilent existence. In dire hopes of acquiring some type of power source to rebuild and
refit their military installations Strogg scientists have discovered and retrieved an ancient 
alien artifact which our physicists tell us allows the Strogg to produce Anti-Matter at an
astronomical rate. With such an abundant source of Anti-Matter the Strogg will have access to
an unheard of amount of energy, and be able to create Matter Anti-Matter bombs of apocalyptic
proportions. I'm talking about bombs that when set off within the vicinity of stars are capable
of making the star go supernova in effect incinerating all planets in that particular system.
According to intelligence the artifact is currently aboard a starship headed toward Stroggos.
The Strogg are doing everything in their power in order to assure the artifact arrives fully
intact, however if they feel for one second that we will intervene and possibly retrieve it,
the Strogg have no quams about releasing the artifact back into space cloaked and undetectable
to our sensors. As it is of the utmost importance that neither scenario takes place this mission
is highly covert. Our best chance of sneaking aboard this ship unseen is with the smallest 
possible vehicle, and its a one-seater. Good luck and God speed soldier the fate of the galaxy 
lies in your hands!

Known Bugs             : For some strange reason the only target_speakers that work are the ones
                         that use brkglas.wav, they are all there but only brkglas.wav works.
                         Also sometimes lasers that are switched on will be invisible. Don't ask me.
