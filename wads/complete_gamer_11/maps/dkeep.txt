Time Spent: What day is this ?

Date Created:  1 June 1998



Well....i think my second map was a step forward.  Visit the Dark Keep, where the weapons
are plenty and the lighting dim at times (hence dark).  Definitely a good place to kill someone or
just end up dead.   Thanks  go out to GMarine, DaFred,  And 1st Degree folks whose opinions 
were quite helpful.   

UPDATE:
Sorry for the update, but i think the changes create a more complete Unreal experience.

Changes Made:
	1.  Bot support fully implemented.
	2.  Few Minor brush/texture fixes that bugged me more than anything.
	3.  Add Flares and Flashlight (two of which are hidden).
	4.  Added Color Lighting.
	5.  Tweaked All lighting.
	6.  Added animated lava and water, including pool ceiling.
	7.  Pulled the Fog in a bit.
	8.  Added Three traps.
		Two are button operated and one is gonna get ya!

Additional thanks go out to Mindbomb, JC Smith, Cableless and those I forgot to mention for comments and requests 
reference this map.
