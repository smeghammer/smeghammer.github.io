Info:

This is my first map for Unreal, and my first DeathMatch map for any game (I did a few SP's for Quake1/2).

I tried to get some of the 'multiple pathways' feel of iD's maps in this one... I must admit I wasn't to impressed with some of the rather basic Unreal DM maps.

This map should be considered _BETA_. I have only had Unreal for about a week and don't realy know the weapons as well as I should to make a decent DM level. If anyone has any ideas for weapon placement or other bug fixes please get in touch.

This map has Bot pathways, although they still seem a bit dumb and don't go for some of the harder to get places. If anyone knows how to fix this, again I'd love to hear from ya!

Look out for some SP maps coming in the future...

Have fun.

P.S. Come say hello on #unrealed, EFNET.

P.P.S You can do what you like with this level (rip it up, move weapons around etc) as a learning tool for PRIVATE use. If you want to do ANYTHING ELSE with this level you MUST ask me first.
