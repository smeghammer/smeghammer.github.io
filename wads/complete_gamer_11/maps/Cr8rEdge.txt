Description             : Single Player Quake 2 Map.
                           This follows the Q2 theme of thin plot and
                           storyline quite nicely ;)

Notes                   : Although this is the first Q2 map I have ever
                           released, it is by no means the first Quake
                           map I've ever made.  I have been designing
                           levels for quite some time now, (since Quake)
                           and decided that it was time to release one.
                           I hope you enjoy the map, and please, drop me
                           an email if you have any comments.

* Other Info *

It is recommended that you play this map on HARD. Although this map
fully supports all three difficulty settings, my aim in creating this
map was to produce a challenging level. But, by all means, if you find
it too much of a challenge, MEDIUM setting would be your next bet.
