DISCLAIMER: Software Quake2 sucks... and so will these maps if they 
	    are played without a 3dfx card :)

----INSTALLATION----
Copy all three .bsp files (arkan0.bsp, arkan1.bsp, arkan2.bsp) 
into a subdirectory of quake2\baseq2 called maps.

(i.e. c:\quake2\baseq2\maps)

Then run quake2.

*Go into the console by pressing the key left of the 1 key (~),
and type in "map arkan0" (yes, that is a zero).

The .bsp extension should not be typed in, and neither the 
inverted commas.

::::::::::::::STORY:::::::::::::::::
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

With Stroggos in ruins and Makron and his body destroyed, you have
now crash landed on Afeitazar, a military base built into one
of the barren rocks in a nearby asteroid feild. Fitting, this military 
base is inhabited by Makron's twin brother, ARKANIAN. 

ARKANIAN and his forces have but one mission:

***To destroy planet Earth.***

With Stroggos destroyed, Afeitazar is rapidly plummeting towards earth,
as there is no gravitational pull holding Afeitazar in orbit.

ARKANIAN is not located in the military base as we first thought, 
but in a large Space Station that is using Afeitazar as a shield
to get close to earth, where he will activate the doomsday device
equipped on his station. 

As long as ARKANIAN stays behind the asteroid, Earth forces will 
not be able to stop him.

**Your mission is as follows:**

As Earth's only chance for survival, you must infiltrate the 
military base on Afeitazar. There is only one point of entrance into 
ARKANIAN's space station, and Intelligence reports that it is 
heavily guarded. Find it, and enter ARKANIAN's lair.
It is probable that you will encounter ARKANIAN and you *will* 
have to kill him. From satelite images, we have determined that 
once he is killed, you will have access to the doomsday device.

Once you have disabled the device, the space station will become unstable. 

This is all the information we have right now, and it is unclear 
whether this station is equipped with escape pods. It is very 
unlikely that they are present, as this station was built to 
serve only one purpose. 

Good luck, soldier - This mission may be your last...

**Some information that might help you in "The Final Trial":

SAVE the quad that you get in "Ruins of Arkanian". It will help 
GREATLY in the final level.

---------------Play Information---------------

Level Name(s)        	: The Arrival, Ruins of Arkanian, Final Trial
Single			: YES.. this is what Quake2 is FOR
Deathmatch		: NO
Coop			: There are about 4 coop spawns.

Comments                : This is well known by most, but let me say it anyway:
				
			  YOU NEED A 3DFX CARD TO FULLY ENJOY THIS...
				  
			  The r_speeds get pretty high in some places, and 
			  the gameplay SUFFERS GREATLY in software q2.
				  
			  I know a lot of things in this map are not perfect, and 
			  I've left it in this state for a reason:
		
				I've spent enough damn time on this already - I NEED to move on.
			
			  There are hundreds of things I could do to make this map better, but 
			  I need to move on to other projects. This was never meant to be  a high 
			  quality production, otherwise, I would have done many things differently.

Known Bugs      : There are probably some bugs that I've overlooked,
		but I've gotten rid of the real serious ones. 
		There are a TON of places where r_speeds are terrible... 
			especially in software q2.		

		Note: In Arkan1.bsp, there are a couple "monster 
		stuck in solid" errors, and those are simply caused
		by the items standing on 8-unit-wide bars. 
		I KNOW ABOUT THESE, so don't email me about them :)

**The story behind the design:**

There were several ideas that I had to abandon in Arkan1. First, after
you shut down the comm center and the area becomes unstable, I had 
originally created a realistic(IMO) effect of boulders bombarding the 
area as you ran to seal off the area. There were several problems with this:

1. It slowed down terribly in both software and GLq2 (too many goddamn boulders)
2. Some brushes were not being drawn in software q2.
3. After running qrad (before, I had just been running qbsp to check things out),
   the boulders (all of them tied to different func_doors) caused an error, killing q2.

For all of these reasons, I decided to get rid of the boulders and employ the
"leaking atmosphere" idea. The boulders would have kicked ass, but I could 
not surpass all of those problems. Especially the fatal error. If you have a 
lot of experience with errors, contact me and I'll go into detail about it.

---------------Legal Stuff---------------

You may NOT include this map in ANY sort of compilation.
But go ahead and ask me anyway :)
