	If you are reading this you may be playing a level it 
took me awhile to make.  This is only my second level but it is
still exceptional ( at least in my opinion ).

The story goes that you are sent down to kill a Baron Strogg who
is holding out in a base deap in a mountain range. You must kill
him and get a data cd which holds information on Strogg 
Technology.

I may make this part of a three part pack.  If you like it let 
me know.  

e-mail me at yourben@juno.com

By the way there is no skill setting for the level. Have fun.
