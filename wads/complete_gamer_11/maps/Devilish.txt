* Other Info *

Well, here it is, my first Quake 2 single-player level.  I think I did a pretty good job, and I
hope you'll enjoy playing it.  I spent some extra time implementing and testing all the
difficulty levels, plus Deathmatch has been included.  Look out for more single-player Quake 2
levels from me in the future.

As usual, if you have anything to say about the level, please let me know through the e-mail
address I have given above.
