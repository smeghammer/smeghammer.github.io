* Story *

Background: This level is set before the events in Quake2. To most people the
existence of the Strogg is merely a wild rumour. The only people who know more
are those who work for the Top Secret "Alien Counter-Insurgency Bureau".

Investigating unexplained UFO sightings, alien abductions and other seemingly
unlikely events, the Bureau has come to the conclusion that behind some of these
events there lies a frightening reality.

It is the Bureau's opinion that a malignant alien force (known as the Strogg) intend
to invade the Earth at some point. Current investigations indicate that the alien's
home planet Strogg lies many light years from Earth, but that they have sent one or
more spacecraft here in order to set up some kind of interstellar wormhole device,
thus allowing a full scale invasion of Earth from Stroggos.

In the last few days contact has been lost with the Freedom Space Station.

All attempts to locate a Strogg earth-side H.Q. have been fruitless. However news has
just come in that a group of agents sent to scout-out one suspected site have not
returned, raising the possibility that the captured agents might reveal the location
of the Bureau's H.Q. under torture...

Now: It's the end of a worrying day at the Bureau. You're just getting ready to
leave the Top Secret headquarters building when the Strogg attack! Using overwhelming
force, and the element of surprise, the Forces Of Evil eliminate practically every
agent within minutes. By chance you were in the basement bathroom when they attacked.
Hearing the FOE approaching, you grab your blaster and get ready to fight...
