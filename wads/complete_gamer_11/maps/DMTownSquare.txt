   the map.

Author's Notes
--------------
1) This level originally had a series of catacombs underneath the town, but even 
   with 16 players the level would have been way too big...maybe in the future I 
   will re-release the level with the catacombs.  (If you're curious, the catacombs 
   could be accessed one of three ways: a button behind the altar which moved one of 
   the pews; a cellar entrance beside the house; and a set of stairs inside the shop.)  

2) Yes, the church did have stained glass windows which you could shatter but it 
   presented an unacceptable number of nodes, so I removed it for better gameplay.
