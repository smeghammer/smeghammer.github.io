Description		: My latest and probably last Q2 SP map for a while. This is the sequel
			  to The BloodShrine, and the finale of what I've come to think of as a 
			  trilogy of maps, including Abandon all Hope. This one's the largest,
			  and IMO the cleanest of the three. There are 2 files, azure.bsp, and 
			  eof.bsp. I split the map into 2 files for personal reasons, as it made 
			  editing easier, and I'm not the type who likes to make alot of detail
			  brushes, thus the vis data was getting too large.
			  Enjoy it, and as usual, let me know
			  what you think.

(Note: The blue lights illuminating the crystals stick around when the crystals
are destroyed. This isn't by choice, it's because of a tricky trigger/counter/targetname problem I 
couldn't get around. This has absolutely no affect on gameplay, though so just ignore this unless 
you're a mapper who knows what I'm talking about and thinks he/she could figure out a 
workaround, in which case mail me your idea)


--------------------------------------------------------------
The Story:
--------------------------------------------------------------
Stroggos:

The Strogg have regrouped since the destruction of the Psionic Nullification 
generator on Charon 6(see BloodShrine). Fortifications
and troop dispersement appear to be most intense around a mining compound within the heart 
of Strogg territory. Scans report signals identical to those produced by the late PsiNull 
generator, and we suspect that a certain crystal necessary to production of the weapon is
located in the mine. We need a brave soul to infiltrate the compound, destroy any 
stockpile of this crystal, and put a rest to this war once and for all.

Guess who we picked?

Your goal is to destroy every PsiCrystal deposit in the mining compound, then escape the vile strogg
by retaking a stolen viper that spies have discovered in the vicinity.

God speed marine!
