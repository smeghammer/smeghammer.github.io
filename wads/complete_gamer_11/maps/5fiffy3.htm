     REoL TOUGH: Prison!  A new level to play with, for Quake II!<br>
     Level Design by George J. Fiffy II.<br>
     HTML FORMAT! MAKES EVERYTHING EASIER AGAIN! Also note, some
     parts of this document WILL NOT WORK if you're not connected to the 
     'net. THIS DOESN'T AFFECT THE ENTIRE DOCUMENTATION!<br>
     <hr>
     Quake II is (c)1998 id Software. All rights reserved.
     <hr>
     If you're trying this with the Test Version, IT WON'T WORK! JUST
     BUY THE WHOLE GAME! Trust me, it's worth more than what you pay. :)<br>
     Will work with ANY version of REGISTERED Quake II (Used 3.05).<br>
     <hr>
     Since REoL TOUGH is an International favorite everywhere (whatever),
     and some people complain about the way things are typed, Here are some
     things you'll need to know:<br>
     * This doc is typed using US English, and bad grammar/spelling. :)<br> 
     * Things IN CAPS highlight important info, among other things.

     HOW TO PLAY:
     <hr>
     (1) Put the level in your C:\QUAKE2\BASEQ2\MAPS directory. If you don't
     have that directory, make it. Maps won't run without it.<br>
     (2) Start a game of Quake II as normal.<br>
     (3) As the game starts up, hit ESC. Now you'll see the Quake Option Menu.<br>
     (4) Hit the ~ key and enter a SKILL level, by entering SKILL X. X is the
     skill you want: 0 for EASY, 1 for NORMAL, and 2 for HARD. Skip the
     SKILL process if you're starting on NORMAL Skill, and go to Step 5.<br>
     (5) Now, enter MAP 5FIFFY3 and LEAVE OFF THE.BSP EXTENTION! Enjoy!<br>
     <hr>
     Supports Single Play, and up to 4 in Multiplayer and 8 in Deathmatch. 16 was
     just overwhelming for REoL TOUGH fans playing these levels of the Quake
     Generation. :) I also learned Quake II doesn't do more than 4 in Multiplayer.<br>
     SORRY, NO CTF SUPPORT! Get a BSP TO MAP CONVERTER and put them in if you
     want it. No knowledge of this game variation whatsoever. :(
     <hr>
     (C)1998 REoL TOUGH. Modify map as you may, as long as credit for the
     orriginal work is given to yours truly.

                               Another Stupid Story:
     <hr>
     In spite of all that hard work you put in at the Teleportation Base that
     was codenamed "The Unforgiven", you realized you worked hard for no real
     reason whatsoever, after you killed the teleporter that transported the
     Strogg Armies to Earth. You were then told that this area may lead into
     their Prison System. Well, you got to the end of your pointless route,
     and got to the Exit, albeit the Tank Commander holding that Red Key
     didn't want to give that up too easilly. Once you killed it, within an
     inch of your own life, your powered up with Medkits, and headed out the
     exit, at which you saw something at the end of this "airlock" of sorts.
     It was dead, dried up blood alongside the corpse, of a dead Space Marine
     that almost made it. His dog tag only listed him as Ken. "OH MY GOD, THEY
     KILLED KENNY!!! YOU BASTARDS!!!" You yell, and seeing that, you have
     declared war on the Strogg for what they've done, once you open those
     other doors to go into, the Prison.
     <hr>
     Just as you stepped into the entry, guards from up front and at the
     narby Electric Chair Stations shoot at you, only to fail, with small
     wounds on yourself nevertheless. You then duck behind one of the chairs
     and pull out your radio: "Anyone in the Prison?"<br>
     A reply came: "Yes, some of us were spared death for the moment, in
     exchange for vital government information to plan another Earth attack.
     We're all in the Main Cell Block, where the others are in a secondary
     unit, but are feared dead, due to horrible conditions in their sector.
     We have a problem here getting out. This time around, the Strogg were
     not dumbfucks when creating this hellhole. One prison we were sent to
     had Forcefields keeping us in, but power failures made it possible to
     escape. Then there were the metal bars places, only to cut or blast
     through the bars. More escapes. The rest of us, were put into this
     hellhole, solid steel doors. Can't cut them, power failures don't make
     the locks fail. Worst off, we sleep in our own shit, no toilets! I'm
     going mad, as well as everyone else that already is. We're weak, and
     we need to get out. I think there's a button that will release us all,
     at least in the Main Block. Not sure if alarms or troops will be
     triggered by it. Heeeeeeelp uuuuuuuuuusss....."
     <hr>
     That's all you have to go by, apperently. Fortunately for you, there's
     several ways, without firearms or explosives of any kind, to kill the
     baddies with their own torturous devices used to kill the inmates. But
     beware, that does not mean you're safe, especially if you're surrounded,
     have only your measilly Blaster, and no chance of getting out, and
     becoming an inmate yourself, only to be tortured for top secret
     information on your government, and then be terminated. Then again, you
     CAN get through this ordeal, can you? If you can, you'll be able to move
     onto another mission, to hop aboard a truck in the Warehouse and sneak
     into a Factory, but we'll have to see if you make it.

     BUT WHY? (Section dedicated to awkward operation and other stuff.)
     <hr>
     Q: I have OpenGL support, and I noticed some lights vary slightly in
        color in spots. Why is this?
     <br>
     Q: I have OpenGL, ad I noticed a lack of colored light. Don't you use
     colors?
     <br>
     <br>
     <br>
     A: If you look at real lights closely, not all of them burn the exact 
     same color. Various types of light were simulated using points of
     light (NOT using Surface Properties). For example, there are typical
     FLOURESCENT LIGHTS, which basically give off white light, but different
     manufacturers or bulbs don't give the exact same hue. Look around a 
     real building. Some of them appear more redish or greenish in nature. 
     This was captured here, just like last-minute bulb replacement, or a 
     ceartain type of bulb were used in other areas.  Some colors represent 
     different TYPES of lights.
     The lightly reddish-yellow ones represent INCADESCENT, or HALOGEN, and
     the bluish-purple ones are SODIUM based. Since I DON'T have OpenGL on
     my system, I took a shot in the dark when creating colored lights. :)
     Of course, like real places, strong(er) colors may be used as well.
     To sum it all up, I went for REALISM (how typical of me). How many
     authors go through this trouble, or just use Surface Properties instead?
     <hr>     
     Q: With Quake II's capabilities, many authors make GIANT levels. Why 
     are you making yours intimate in nature?
     <br>
     <br>
     <br>
     A: If you played my Quake 1 maps, they were mostly too intimate because
     I didn't have the memory or HD space to make huge levels. Quake II, on 
     the other hand, has a very efficient BSP (map) structure, so memory and 
     HD space are no problem. However, these intimate settings, you must 
     admit, are not as close and personal as Quake 1. Once again, it's all in
     realism. If in real life, we made these big structures id and other 
     authors made, they would be CONDEMNED on the spot by Building 
     Inspectors, if they didn't COLLAPSE already! My structures more or less
     represent what can be built in real life, and aren't so overwhelming 
     either.
     <hr>
     Q: In your Quake 1 maps, you had 16 player support for Deathmatch. Why 
     only 4 in Multi's, and 8 for Deathmatch?
     <br>
     <br>
     <br>
     A: Got WAY too many complaints from Deathmatchers that the level was 
     WAY OVERCROWDED to enjoy a 16 player fight. Keeping realistic size in
     account, chopping the headcount in half should make everyone happy. As
     for the Multiplayers, Quake II only allows a mere 4 starting spots.
     <hr>
     Q (Player): I have a P2/400 and OpenGL support. I get 3,000FPS playing 
     at 1920x1440. I get to a door, and it drops to a mere 1,000! Why?
     <br>
     Q (Designer): Areas with doors go slow. Why no FUNC_AREAPORTALS?
     <br>
     <br>
     <br>
     With my system, every polygon counts big time, and I'm not talking how
     many in view, but how many that make up THE LEVEL ITSELF. Unless truly
     necessary, no FUNC_AREAPORTALS will be used, since they've been known to
     cause Hall of Mirrors too. With limited resources, my EDITOR can only 
     only work with needed polys (bogs down greatly about 1200 brushes). I
     have no OpenGL support, so don't tell me about the game going slow. :)
     <hr>
     Q: I get error messages (*something* is not a field, monster stuck in
     wall, etc.) when the map loads. Is this bad?
     <br>
     <br>
     <br>
     A: These levels are playtested for problems, AND DOABILITY (HARD 
     setting). If messages appear when you start up the map, they will not 
     affect the outcome of the game, they are just bullshit. I'll TRY to 
     remember to prevent them before release. :)
     <hr>
     Q: I don't get it. You kill a baddy, and you get their armor? Isn't it
     no good if you killed them?
     <br>
     <br>
     <br>
     A: Not necessarilly. You can shoot them in the legs, face, or other
     parts not protected by the armor. If you did shoot through it anyway, it
     STILL has places to protect you. After all, why do you take damage when
     you get hit? It's not as unrealistic as some people think!
     <hr>
     Q: This level is so linear. How can this be fun in Deathmatch?
     <br>
     <br>
     <br>
     A: This level is linear in Single and Multiplayer, but NOT in
     Deathmatch! All doors impeding ANY semilinear flow will not show up.
     Also, the prison sirens will not sound, and flashing lights will 
     stay fullbright.

     Hints and Tips:
     <hr>
     (1) For added realism, all guns aquired are from the enemies who drop
     them when you (or anoter foe) kill them. This also goes for needed
     armor.
     <br>
     <br>
     (2) You can kill enemies with the machines of death within the prison.
     Be warned, you are not the ONLY ones that know how to use them!
     <br>
     <br>
     (3) When you hit the EXIT button and release the Inmates (this is not
     YOUR way out, by the way), watch for a pack of enemies that may come.
     Don't watch the Parade-O'-Inmates head out, unless you want your own
     funeral. Wait until it's safe. :)
     <br>
     <br>
     (4) This level provides you with SQUAT for ammo. Use your BLASTER as
     often as possible.
     <br>
     <br>
     (5) There's THREE secrets. If you thought the ones in other maps were
     tough to find, try finding THESE!!! :D   Got sharp eyes, my friend?
     <br>
     <br>
     (6) DEATHMATCHERS: There's MANY places to grab a weapon, so there's 
     plenty to go around. You may have to go exploring. YOU CAN NOT CAMP for
     weapons without being wide open for attack. :)<br>
     <br>
     <br>
     (7) Learn the machines of death quite well. Some of these executing
     devices act differently, in terms of activating, and protecting your
     own hide from possible penetration. Most traps will have a button to
     either keep victims from reaching you (in forms of closing doors), and
     another button to activate the death machine itself. None are fully
     automatic! Sometimes, the button that closes that door behind you might
     also trap the victim in the death machines, or the activation of a
     machine may also trap them.

     <center>
     Known Boo-boos:
     <hr>
     (1) Some Grayouts (Software Mode) and HOM (OpenGL) are present. No idea
     why, because they are fast moving and low detailed areas. QVIS3 did
     something funny. This happens in the second, smaller cell block.
     <br>
     <br>
     (2) MAY NEED COAXING TO RUN! It might've been my Q2 went currupt. :) I
     reinstalled Q2 and all was fine. In the event something DOES go wrong,
     read the DEADMAP.TXT file.
