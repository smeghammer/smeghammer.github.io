Title:Al'Shar Temple

This is the first level I ever created using UnrealED. I used everything I learned at this point to make a map that 
has an egyptian/ancient style to it. I used Lens Flare effects, Fog, Water section, portals and a lift.
Hope it helps in any way. I want to thank the people in #UnrealED on EfNet, especially Zorkwiz, |Speed|, JonR, MindBomb, Cableless, TheEngine and
|Pegasus|.
