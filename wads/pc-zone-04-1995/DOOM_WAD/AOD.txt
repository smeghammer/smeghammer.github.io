ARMY OF DOOM V0.9
****************************

1). So why did I do it?

Well, I know that there's already an Army of Darkness patch for DOOM, 
ASH-DOOM.ZIP, but (with apologies to the author) I was disappointed with
it.  There really weren't enough AOD sounds to it.  I had about 13MB of
AOD wav files, a few hours to kill during school so decided to give it a go.

2). Why's it only V0.9?

This is simple, sort of.  I had originally wanted to change the intro pic
to the cover of AOD, BUT, my friend Geoff never got around to bringing over
the comic book, so I never scanned it, that's why it took my so long to 
actually upload this thing.  Also, I wanted to change the little guy 
at the bottom of the screen to something that resembled Bruce Campbell
more, but, I haven't gotten around to it yet.

3). How do I use it?

The file enclosed is a sounds only WAD file.  It uses different sounds as
a shell to your regular DOOM.WAD file.  It doesn't do anything to any of
your original DOOM files if you follow this wasy step:

at the DOS prompt type:
c:\doom\doom -file AOD.WAD

It's as easy as that.  Even better would be to get a copy of DOOMLOAD and
then you can use Army of DOOM with any other PWAD as long as the others do
not contain any sound files.

4). My Thanks.
