Description:             This is a replacement wad for Episode 1, level 2.  It has a few     
						 secret areas and only the shotgun to find.  This makes the floor    
						 much more difficult, but I didn't want to pack a whole episode  
						 into one floor. :)  The texturing is all lined up so you may have   
						 to use a cheat to find the secret areas.  <G>
Notes:                   Only one thing, beware of the final room.  <EG>
