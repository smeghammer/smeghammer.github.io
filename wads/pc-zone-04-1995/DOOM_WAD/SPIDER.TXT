Filename                : SPIDER.WAD
Author                  : Carl Tranter
Email Address           : spider1@mail.soton.ac.uk
Misc. Author Info       : Computer Programmer at the
                          University of Southampton, UK.

Description             : Spider contains one mission, features loads
                          of secret doors and areas, new graphics,
                          nicely aligned textures :-), never before
                          seen room designs and some porn (gasp!), so if
                          you are easily offended, PLAY IT!

Additional Credits to   : Brendon Wyber for taking the time to rebuild the
                          file structure of my WAD and for all the help he
                          has given me; cheers again Brendon.

Other Notes             : I would appreciate your comments, suggestions
                          and criticisms of this WAD. I may decide to add
                          to it if I get enough interest. Until then, my
                          next project is to create a new character like
                          the excellent Bunny3D (nice one David).
