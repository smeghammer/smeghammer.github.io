Description             : This level is my first, and as such was designed
                          to demonstrate an idea I had to simulate 3D play by
                          silencing the teleporter and making the destination
                          look like the jump point. Once I demonstrated that
                          it worked I made a hardcore shotem' up because my
                          roomates complained that DOOM is too easy. The level
                          lacks a "motif" and I was lazy with the textures
                          but if you have time to notice you must be a DOOM
                          GOD. An included file toughguy.bat replaces the
                          nessesary sounds & graphics, plays the game (with
                          added extensions) then restores on exit. To play
                          unzip all files to your DOOM dir and type
                          "toughguy". The bat file calls DMGRAPH & DMAUD so
                          you'll need them too.
