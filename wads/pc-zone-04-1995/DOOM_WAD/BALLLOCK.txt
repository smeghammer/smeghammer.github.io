Description             : This is just a short jaunt through E2M1.  There's
                          no cool story behind it, and it's not really even
                          that hard.  If you like a short killing spree
                          without having to battle some idiot's 50 cyberdemons
                          and remember all the cheat sequences you can, this
                          is definitely for you.  Unfortunately, you probably
                          don't exist.
