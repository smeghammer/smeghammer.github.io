Description             : This level was designed primarily as a
                          three to four player deathmatch, but it
                          can also be played through as a single
                          player game. The level is based round
                          a large central cavernous room containing 
                          four gun turrets. As a deathmatch level,
                          the best places to be (in terms of where
                          to find weapons and good ambush/sniper
                          points) are also the most dangerous. These
                          are the deadzones.

Additional Comments	: When playing in deathmatch, try running the
  level on -skill 1 and -respawn. This puts four deaf and wall facing
  humanoids in the level which are dead easy to kill, and provides a
  nice way of introducing fresh ammo into the game. There are also a
  number of 'stores' hidden around, which can provide that well needed
  health boost.
