Awsopale.wad Info
-----------------
I hope you enjoy this wad file.  It is my second real effort at constructing 
a level.  Have at it.  Enjoy the maiming and killing.

The level is named after the song "A Whiter Shade of Pale."  It 
has some huge rooms with varying number of monsters determined 
by the difficulty setting.

I have also included the files newwepn.deh and dehacked.exe.  
In your Doom directory, type in "dehack newwepn.deh" and it 
will patch your doom.exe with super weapons and infinite ammo.
