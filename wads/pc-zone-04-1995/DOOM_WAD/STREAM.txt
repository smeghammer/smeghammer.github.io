Misc. Author Info       : Waiting for v1.4 and HOPING id fixes (changes) 
                          the 2 sided linedef maximum to prevent HOM's.
                          If this is the case, I will be re-releasing an
                          improved PURDUE.WAD that is better and faster
                          than the original.

Description             : Designed to be a deathmatch only level. There 
                          no monsters in here (add some if you want) so
                          single player might get dull real quick :-)
                          This is not a very big level, well actually it's
                          quite small but should be fun and fast paced.
                          Just run around and kill your friends !
