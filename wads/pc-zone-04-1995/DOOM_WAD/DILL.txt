                          My wife for putting up with me and my 
                          doom level making schemes, especially when I 
                          ignored the in-laws on the 4th of July to go
                          play DOOM (I'm sure you can understand what 
                          I mean).

* Construction *

Base                    : New level from scratch
Editor(s) used          : WADED versions 117 and 123  <- excellent
                          DEU to meld the two levels into one WADFILE.
Known Bugs              : I think we fixed it, but there used to be a bug, 
                          where you would fall in this hole that wasn't 
                          there.  It was really wierd.  Report it to Piet
                          if you see it again, maybe we'll figure out 
                          what it was caused by.
