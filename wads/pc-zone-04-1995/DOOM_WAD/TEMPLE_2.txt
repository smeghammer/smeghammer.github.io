Description             : You are entering the big temple of DOOM.
			  This is the second and last version of TEMPLE

			  After some reviews, I changed some rooms, added
			  some others...

			  I think it's a good single player WAD. It couls be 
			  a good Cooperative WAD ('cause I think it's a little
			  harder than ID levels), but an experimented DM player
			  said me it was too big to make a good DM WAD.

			  I enjoyer to build it... Hope you'll enjoy play it...

                          Thanx. (and excuse me for my bad english...)
