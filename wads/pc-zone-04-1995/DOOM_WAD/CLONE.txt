                      CLONED MARINE PATCH

This Dehacked file will patch your doom.exe file so the Imp's are replaced 
with cloned marines equipped with plasma rifles.

To patch your doom.exe file you will need DeHackEd v. 1.3 by Greg Lewis. 

Make sure to back up your original doom.exe file!!!!

Example command line:

	dehacked c:\doom\doom.exe -load clone.deh

  This will start DeHackEd, using the doom.exe file in c:\doom, and update
it with the clone.deh patch file.

Special thanks to Greg Lewis for DeHackEd and to id for DOOM!

Any questions or comments welcomed.
