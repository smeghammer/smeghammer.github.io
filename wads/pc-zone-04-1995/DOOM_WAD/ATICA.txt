Misc. Author Info       : This is my first .wad file, so I

Description             : Man, you've done it now.  You not only                          
                          hit your commanding officer, you blew
                          his friggin' head off!  Your sentence:
                          Death, by gas chamber.  You will be
                          held at Atica maximium security prison.
                          You have 1 hour before that sentence is 
                          carried out.  Alone, you contemplate 
                          what you might have been.  But wait!  
                          Here comes the guard!  Thinking quick, 
                          you grab his gun and shoot him with it.  
                          Sorry man, but there's no turning back 
                          now.  Can you make it?  It won't be easy 
                          (better not be).
