Description             : This is one of several .wad files I have
			  created exclusively deathmatch.  In it contains
 			  a huge arena, several small rooms around the arena,
			  multiple weapons, bonusus, secrets, traps and
			  absolutely no monsters.  FRAGMAN has been play
			  tested several times and has been found to be
			  plentiful in frags (hence the name).  Any and all
			  comments are welcome.  Email Rob at CSERVE 73632,3627
