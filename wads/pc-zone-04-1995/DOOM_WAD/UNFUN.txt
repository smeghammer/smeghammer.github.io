Title                   : My First Doom Level   
Filename                : unfun.WAD
Author                  : Adrian Roselli
Email Address           : v067rcyf@ubvms.cc.buffalo.edu
Misc. Author Info       : i'm tired.
			  and hungry.
Description             : It's nasty, barbaric, and I don't quite
			    know why I made it.
			  It's also one of the few wads made 
			    recently (I think) that doesn't require
			    God mode to win it or enjoy it.
Additional Credits to   : DEU and them guys for their swell editor
