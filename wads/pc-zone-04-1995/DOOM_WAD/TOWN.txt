                        THE WHOLE CITY'S GONE TO HELL!

Introduction...

After returning from your latest mission, you and your buddies looked forward 
to some R&R.  Lately, it seems as though you've been plastering so many
demons, you count them in your sleep!

There's little time for rest, though.  Soon, you and your buddies are called
into the briefing room.  Something has happened at Cydonia-130: a small 
settlement and research station on Phobos.

The peaceful settlement has been turned upside down by a hideous invasion.
You listen to the last reports from Cydonia-130:

"Our security force is trying to hold back the invasion... things are
looking grim... they're breaking through everywhere!  My God!  Oh,
what carnage!  Oh, the humanity!  We need help fast!  We need... oh no!
Argh!... <slurp>... <burp>"

Your commander follows with your orders:

"Well, the city's gone to hell.  We need to get it back.  Your group is
ordered to drop down to Cydonia-130 and destroy those fraggin' evil
monsters.  The settlement is divided into 3 sections, all united by a
central access hub.  Eradicate all enemy forces, so we can return to the
settlement.  Chances are those evil beasts have massacred all the
inhabitants... or maybe they've been mutated.  Whatever the case, kill
EVERYTHING that looks mean and nasty."

"Expect heavy resistance.  You will have to liberate the settlement
building-by-building.  The settlement had an armory which might still
have a stash of weapons that will be of great benefit.  Don't forget
to find and destroy the enemy in the granite pits, which should be
accessible from inside the settlement."

"Also, try to find out what happened to the commander of Cydonia.  His
headquarters is in a small palace in the northern section.  Hopefully,
those evil monsters haven't gotten to him yet... good luck."

You are transported from headquarters to Phobos.  You land, and are supplied
with "adequate" ammunition to accomplish the task.  You move through a
cavern, and to an opening.  Cydonia-130 lies in the distance.

As you approach, you notice something in the fortifications guarding the
entrance.  It's definitely not human.  Suddenly, you realize that this
ammo isn't going to be enough.  This ain't gonna be a pretty sight.
