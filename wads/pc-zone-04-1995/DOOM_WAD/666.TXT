Yet another new Doom level.

This level replaces e1m1 but uses textures/monsters/weapons from
the registered version.  It is my first 'complete' new level.  As such
it wasn't entirely planned out first, but I think you'll think it is worth
the download anyway.

It was created using DEU 5.0 and BSP 1.0.  Many congrats to the authors of
those programs.

It has all skill levels and it is set up for multiplayer.  It was designed
for ultra-violence and is fairly challenging I think (so I've been told by
others who played it), but it is definitely possible in UV.  A reasonable
'par' time for 100% on everything is about 9-10 minutes.  I'm sure it can
be done faster (but not much).

Please email me with any comments/problems/suggestions.  My address is
stimson@leland.stanford.edu.

I hope you have fun.
