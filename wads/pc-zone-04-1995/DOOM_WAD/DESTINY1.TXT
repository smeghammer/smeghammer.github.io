* Insider's Information *

I designed this level one room at a time.  I stayed in each room until it
looked just like I wanted it to.  In single player mode, it is very linear,
and if you stick with the plan, you won't have to do any backpeddling.  This
WAD boasts one of the biggest, tallest rooms I've seen (though I haven't
seen a HUGE number of WADS) with no noticeable ill effects.  If you play it
through on UltraViolent, you shouldn't have trouble beating it, but it
should be challenging.  Always remember there's always more than one way to
skin a cat, or kill a baron.   MINOR SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!  For more fun,
				elude the barons, hit their switch and
				advance.  Come back to kill them.

This WAD wasn't designed with DeathMatch in mind, but when my buddy and I
played it to test it out, we had a great time.  There's not an overabundance
of weapons, although they all appear.  The BFG is limited to one or two
shots in original deathmatch, and it's hard to get to without being pummeled
by your opponent.

I thouroughly enjoyed making this level (and yes, I'm one of those goobers
who's going to say, "This is my first official WAD release....").  I hope
you all have fun playing it.  Please give me some feedback, as my next
level is in the works.   Look for DESTINY2.WAD coming in the next 6 or
7 months....  ;-)  (Okay, hopefully much sooner!)
