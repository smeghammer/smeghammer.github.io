Title                   : COLOSEUM.WAD 
Author                  : Dean Ashley Svendsen
Email Address           : DASVE1@AURORA.CC.MONASH.EDU.AU
Misc. Author Info       : I've only got a 386SX-20 :(

Description             : This has been designed with deathmatch in
mind.  There's PLENTY of opportunity for suicides, and absolutely
NO ambush points!  Rather, this is a "Keep moving and watch your back"
WAD.  There are rooms outside the main arena, but the nature of these
forces the player to spend very little time in them (or eternity :)
so its unlikely that you'd have trouble finding the other player(s).
And yes, since this is my first WAD, the Cyberdude makes an appearance.
(By the way, I've managed to kill him twice, accidentally, without
firing a shot at him.  Dontcha just love teleporters ;) 
For those of you who hate the pistol, extra weaponry is provided at
the start.  Just watch out for the pink things. :)  All the weapons
are available in various places, you just gotta go look!

Expect lots of fatalities in this WAD.  

Additional Credits to   : Eric Staeberhofer & Luis Pampliega for
                            playtesting, and Eric for providing
                            some half-decent PC's.
                          The authors of DEU.  Good work!
                          Those nice people at id.
