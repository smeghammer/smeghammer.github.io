Misc. Author Info       : Avid Deathmatch Player
Description             : A Deathmatch level, but fully
			  implemented for the weak or cooperative.
			  It has 2 ways to exit, one of them being
			  cooperative.  The other one is blocked off
			  during multi-player games.  (Just try and get by
			  those candles!)  Good stalking and good sniper
			  points.

			  If anyone wants to make a stab at some Batman
			  "BAM!!!!!" sounds or some graphics, go right
			  ahead.  (Just let me know when you do!)
