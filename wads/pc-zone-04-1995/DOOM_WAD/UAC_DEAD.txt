* Misc *
Since the version 0.9 that I released on 6/8/94, This level has
been changed so much in terms of the cosmetic changes and playability.

Playing in UV, at the beginning is pretty rough, some common sense
of what part of a complex should contain is needed.
"And the rest are just details." :)

remember to drop me your thoughts via email, ok?

Warn you, below are features in this WAD. 
They may contain some spoilers to you.

- Courtyard with 2 parts of overturned truck.
- "The Staircase". Remember the last of the 3 tests that Indiana Jones
  had to take? :)
- Big letters of U A C.
- Part of the map that resemble uac logo.
- The escape shuttle. (I could have made this one look better, 
  but i'm out of 2S linedefs).
