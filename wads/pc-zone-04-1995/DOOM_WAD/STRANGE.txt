Description             : This was just a WAD I was playing with
                          while I was reviewing a number of WAD
                          editors. It is not designed to be in 
                          the least bit clever. It does, howver,
                          have one remarkable feature. There is
                          a room in which all the 'baddies'
                          turn into nice guys, and refuse to
                          attack either you, or each other!
                          If they are outside the room, they
                          will shoot you, while you are in
                          the room, and you can happily blast
                          their nuts off. A side effect of all
                          this is that barrels refuse to explode
                          with their normal vehemence, and do
                          not kill or injure passers by.
