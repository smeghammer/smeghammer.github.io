Misc. Author Info       : Doom! rocks my world!  I can be reached at
                          the above address, but place my name in the
                          subject...

Description             : This level pushes DOOM to the limits of
                          complexity.  Half of the areas had to be toned
                          down in detail and sophistication so the "side-def"
                          limitation would not be violated.  It was designed
                          first and foremost as a 1 player level, although
                          multiplayer should prove enjoyable as well.  As far
                          as deathmatch, I believe its too big and complex
                          to be good for that.  The starts and weapons are
                          there though, so give it a try if you like.

Editor(s) used          : DEU 5.1, BSP 1.1x
Known Bugs              : not really a bug, but it might run slower than
                          most levels due to its complexity.  There is an
                          area where the sidedef limitation was violated.
                          A shimmering effect can be seen way off in the
                          distance, but its location does not interfer with
                          gameplay.
