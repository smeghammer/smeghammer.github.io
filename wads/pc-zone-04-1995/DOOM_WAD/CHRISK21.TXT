Joke                    : This lady walks into a doctor's office, and
                          says, "Doctor, my husband thinks he's a
                          refrigerator!"  To which the doctor replies,
                          "That's nothing.  I wouldn't worry if I were
                          you."  And the lady says, "But he sleeps with
                          his mouth open, and that little light keeps
                          me up all night!"
