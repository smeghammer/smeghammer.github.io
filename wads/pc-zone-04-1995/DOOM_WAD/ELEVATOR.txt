Well, here it is, my first totally new level!  For lack of a better name
(actually, you'll see where I derived the name from at the beginning of 
the level), ELEVATOR.WAD is a "stock" Doom PWAD that continues the basic
theme/layout seen in Episode 1.  This level was not designed as a complete
blastfest or a extra-difficult puzzle-type level, but it does have some
interesting obstacles and a few nasty traps.  The level is average in
size (55K) which means that it will run fast and you don't have to worry
about a lot of slowdown that you see in the bigger levels.

This level was originally designed for network play, but is also ideal
for single player games.  The level is "professionally" done, wall/ceiling
and switch textures match fairly well and are consistent.

P.S.  There is one nasty trap which there is no recovery if you fall for it!
Watch the floor/ceiling textures and placement of objects, and you should
notice the trap and be diligent about getting through this part of the
level.  Also, for people who hate acid pits with no escape, there are some
in the level.  These enclosed acid pits have nothing at the bottom, so
don't jump in them out of curiosity!  :-)
