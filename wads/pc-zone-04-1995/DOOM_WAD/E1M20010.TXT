Description             : This level is a nice one for multi-
                          player cooperative monster bashing.
                          It is not suited for deathmatch
                          players. They will be dead allmost
                          immediately.

                          The layout of the area is quit simple.
                          But the monster bashing is fun. Four
                          supermonsters (one in single-user
                          play). Hordes of imps, sargeants, and
                          troopers. Allmost no bonusses, but
                          lots and lots of weapons and ammo.
                          Some small traps.

                          This is the first DOOM-level I
                          designed.
