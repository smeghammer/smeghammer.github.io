How to play it          : (insert obvious stuff here)
                          If you have version 1.4 shareware and
                          1.2 registered (as I have), then use
                          the 1.4 .exe with the 1.2 .wad, and
                          add the bitmaps WIMINUS and STTMINUS,
                          as done by this level. It'll quit if 
                          you let it run a demo, so be quick!

Description             : This is a very large wad (about 230k),
                          mainly because of all the detail I
                          put in. I would have released it a lot
                          earlier, but I had to wait for the GCC
                          version of DEU when it got too big. 
                          Then, I had to wait for Doom 1.4 when
                          it got too complex. But now I have got
                          everthing finished, and if you run it
                          as described should be no HOMs, etc.,
                          unlike some... It will probably run
                          slow in places on less than a DX2, but
                          I had to comprimise for quality. I hope
                          that I have made this level fun to play
                          as well as good to look at, but only
                          you can decide that.

Background story        : The Cooper's Creosote factory has been
                          taken over by the Cyberdemon with his
                          evil hordes of hellspawn, and everyone
                          working there has been violently killed
                          or enslaved. It is up to you to stop
                          them. Cooper's Creosote is a toxic,
                          orange-brown liquid made by boiling
                          water, nuclear waste, and blood under
                          pressure - not wood tar, as many people
                          think.

                          The lift up from the nukeage bit with lost
                          souls you teleport to (you'll see it) goes
                          green when it is activated. Also, it very
                          occasionally goes down, not up. I tried
                          all the linedef types, but no luck.
