Misc. Author Info       : If somebody says "Wolfenstein" in a crowded
                          room, I can hear it over all the noise! <g>

Description             : You must work your way through an onslaught
                          of demonic creatures which have invaded a
                          nuclear testing facility. Your goal is to
                          enter the mysterious subterranean caverns from
                          whence the demons came (E2M9) and destroy all the
                          Barons who oversee the invasion force. Of course,
                          you could always just waltz out the normal way...
                          But what fun is that?

Comments                : Mission 1 (E2M5) was built from a Spear of Destiny
                          level, designed by Bryan Baker. I preserved (for
                          the most part) the 64x64, 90-degree-angles
                          construction of it, with a dash of varying heights
                          and depths here and there. I think you'll enjoy it
                          anyway, as I use some neat effects with lighting
                          that really give the level that "realistic feel".
                          Also, don't expect to find any misaligned wall
                          textures anywhere on this level. There might be a
                          little one somewhere, but for the most part every-
                          thing is as it should be.

                          You Trekkers should like the secret level! <g>
                          
                          I recently recieved some more of Bryan's old levels
                          and am in the process of converting yet another one
                          into Doom. If you liked this one, let me know and
                          I'll keep working!

-=ð Construction ð=-

Base                    : New level from scratch
Editor(s) used          : * DOOM Edit Utility (DEU) Versions 5 - 5.21, both
                            standard and DOS Extender (GO32/DJGPP) versions.
                          * RG-DoomEd 1.1 (used to print hardcopy to aid in
                            debugging)
                          * BSP 1.1x by Colin Reed
                          * REJECT 1.0 by L.W. Witek
Known Bugs              : In the large "dining room" style area in the
                            southwest corner of the map, there tends to be
                            a little slowdown and an occasional sliver of a
                            clipping error. But that's the node-builder's
                            job, not mine.

-=ð Credits ð=-

* Bryan Baker for the original Spear of Destiny level design (E2M6).
* Id Software for DOOM itself.
* Raphael Quinet, Brendon Wyber, and others for DEU.
* Colin Reed for BSP v1.1x.
* L.W. Witek for Reject 1.0.
* Bill Nesius for DMAUD and all his other utilities.
* Leo Martin Lim for that neato idea on the invisible sectors that the
    player can walk on (UAC_DEAD.WAD).
* Whoever originally came up with the idea for that "flickering
    light around the torches" thing, I credit them.<g> I believe it may
    have been Scott Armspoker (OPOST21.WAD, my favorite Doom level).
* Scott Armspoker for his very helpful file, "Managing Textures and the
    'Unpegged' Attribute". This guy really seems to know what he's doing!

-=ð SPEAR OF DESTINY to DOOM ð=-
     -= Conversion Chart =-

     Anybody else got a nice Wolf3D or Spear level they would like to play in
Doom but aren't sure how to go about making it? Redrawing the map data
(walls, doors, etc.) is easy, since Wolf3D and Spear is limited to 64x64
dimensions and Doom is not. But the theme of the game is different, so the
objects and actors are different, as well. And what about those textures?
Well, here's my conversion chart for these things:

    SPEAR / WOLF3D                   DOOM
