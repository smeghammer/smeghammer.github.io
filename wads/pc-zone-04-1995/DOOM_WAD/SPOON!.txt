                          This is my first released level, let me 
                          know what you think!

Description             : You ain't seen nothing like it!  It's big,
                          it's blue, it's FRAGGIN time!

Level notes             : This is a large room with 3 primary levels.
                          Top-center, middle-outer-ring and lower-pit.
                          Supports Deathmatch v2.0 concepts.  I spent
                          alot of time trying getting the little details
                          right.  There's an exit switch in the elevated
                          ooze pool.

Additional Credits to   : Karen, my SO for putting up with me during
                          its creation and Bill, Steve, Steve & Willie
                          for testing and ideas.

                          I figured it's the best level to play if you're
                          not using Deathmatch v2.0 rules.  Medium has
                          very few monsters. Hard has a few extra enemies
                          wandering around.

* Construction *

Base                    : New level from scratch
Build Time              : 30-40 hours over 2 months!!!
Editor(s) used          : DEU 5.21 and BSP 1.2x
Known Bugs              : This level was a constant battle against what I 
                          wanted the level to look like, and what the DOOM
                          engine let me put in.  Because of HOM, I was
                          constantly reducing the complexity of the level.
                          I've tested on v1.2 and v1.666, several HOM 
                          appear when using v1.2; v1.666 runs fine.  I'm
                          not sure about the other versions.
