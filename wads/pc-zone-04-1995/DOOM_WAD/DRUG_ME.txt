                          any more. My old WADs (BIOTECH.WAD and KAIOWAS.WAD)
                          had this e-mail address. Thanks.

Misc. Author Info       : I tried to stay with the Sepultura theme of WAD
                          naming here. Although Sepultura didn't write Drug
                          Me, they did their own version of it, which is 
                          kinda cool. Unfortunately, this WAD has nothing
                          to do with drugs or me :) Hope you like it anyway.
                          I really hate DEU. During the construction of this
                          WAD, I managed to crash it a record (for me) 21 
                          times. I finally had to get DoomCAD to repair the
                          mistakes left by DEU. Whenever I tried to delete
                          a single wall with DEU, the entire level would 
                          crash and change almost all the walls to "DO NOT
                          USE" or something like that. If anyone knows the
                          cause of this or has any suggestions/solutions, I
                          would greatly appreciate some e-mail. Thanks.

Description             : A rather large level. I had it up past 300K, but  
                          had to "trim" once Doom started crashing. Features
                          many areas designed for multiplayer (deathmatch 
                          or co-op), including windows and some sniping
                          spots. Can be played completely with single player,
                          though.

                          labeled DEAF don't seem to always stay deaf.
