* Info *
This is a pretty strait foward PWAD.  I got the idea while watching the US
open.  It should take under par to complete, but it isn't impossible to die
trying.  Tips, first take out the "umpires", but keep your opponent in mind.
Anything other than UV, I use the fist to get their attention.  If you liked
it, thought it was stupid or whatever don't hesitate to e-mail me.
