Description             : `Acorn Hardas' rides again - I played at pwad
                          making with `The Impzone' and Imp Zone II,
                          I tried harder with `Vengeance' but here's my
                          best shot!    

                          I can only hope it gives as much pleasure playing
                          it, as it gave me to construct.
                          JUST HAVE FUN but be careful out there!

                                     ---------------------------

                          The file is URANUS.WAD and is level E1M2, i.e. 
 		 	  episode 1 mission 2.  The difficulty settings have
                          been set up as `differently' settings!
                          For instance, in `baby' mode you only get Troopers,
                          but on the other hand, your stuck with the loley
                          handgun.  All levels can be done without cheats!


Disclaimer              : Tested as far as possible but if you get problems
                          Don't use it and please let me know.
