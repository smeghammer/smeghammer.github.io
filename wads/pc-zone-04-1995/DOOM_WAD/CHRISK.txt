* Construction *

Base                    : New levels from scratch, except E1M8,
                          for which I used id Software's "Phobos
                          Anomaly" as a base.
Editor(s) used          : DEU 5.2.1; BSP 1.0; REJECT 1.0
Words                   : Man!  What a long, strange trip it's been!
                          I would like to thank everyone who has
                          supported the ChrisK levels, and I would
                          be honored if CHRISK.WAD were to become a
                          permanent part of your Doom directory.
                          Take care, have fun, and blow the heads
                          off a few smelly imps!  :D

Probably lots of other places I don't know about yet.  ;)

Check out EDEN and REDRUM by Mal Blackwell, as well as DANTE'S GATE and
CROSSING ACHERON by John W. Anderson.  I drew much inspiration from the
works of Mal and John.  :)
