Requires have DeHackEd by Greg Lewis
    and DMADDS by Bernd Kreimeier
                             
Files included with flamthwr.zip:

DMFLAME.TXT     -this text file
FLAMETHR.TXT     -text file by Night Child
FLAMETHR.DEH     -Dehacked patch by Night Child
FLAME.WAD        -Graphics file by Patrick McBride

I have added graphics to Night Child's original DeHackEd flame thrower patch.
There are two new graphics, which are:

Side view pic of Flame Thrower
Pic of FT while you are holding it

-- Instructions: 

*Warning* before doing this, make sure DOOM.EXE is backed up!


-To read the Flame Thrower DeHackEd patch by Night Child type:

Dehacked c:\doom -load flamethr.deh     
("c:\doom" can be substituted with the directory where the DOOM.EXE you want 
to use is)


-To put FLAME.WAD graphics into Doom using DMADDS type: 

Dmadds flame.wad fire.wad

FIRE.WAD will take a few minutes to be created, and will take up about 2 megs 
of memmory.

-To run Doom with the graphics type:

Doom -file fire.wad


-To get Doom back to normal just copy your backup of DOOM.EXE over the one
you changed
