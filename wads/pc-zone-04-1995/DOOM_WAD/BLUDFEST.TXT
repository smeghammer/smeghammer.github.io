Description             : Basically you run around shooting at monsters 
                          and picking up stuff while the monsters are
                          shooting at you.

Seeing as how all I did was use programs written by other people to 
assemble a unique level, I seriously doubt that I have a legal basis 
for establishing any copyright restrictions regarding this level. 

Have fun.
