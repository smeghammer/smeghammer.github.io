Title                   : Ben's DOOM Sounds

Description             : These are some sounds I recorded and
                          editted to replace ALL the creatures'
                          sounds.  As well, the pistol fire sound
                          has been replaced with a hollow sounding
                          gun fire but it has a neat ending: the
                          sound of bullet shells hitting the ground!
                          I'm placing these sounds in
                          a separate PWAD file instead of putting
                          them into actual level PWAD files
                          to allow users the option of including
                          or not including the sounds (after all,
                          you may get sick of the voices - I know
                          I did! :).
Additional Credits to   : Jen Tiffin (for doing the Baron's voice), 
                          and James LeBlanc (for supplying a mysterious
                          sounding pistol fire WAV file).

* Construction *

Base                    : New sounds from scratch
Editor(s) used          : SB16 Windows Utils, GoldWave v2.1, DMAUD v1.1
Known Bugs              : When I used DMAUD to put the WAV files into a PWAD
                          a noticeable "popping" sound was appended to the
                          end of each sound.  This "popping" sound is NOT in
                          the original WAV files.  I don't know why DMAUD
                          does this.
