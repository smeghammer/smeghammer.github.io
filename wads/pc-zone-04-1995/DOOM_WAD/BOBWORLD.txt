Well, another E2M1 for you.....

This was made over the course of a few days using Deu 5.0b(still can't
seem to get the release version to work right.)  

We designed it for deathmatch, in fact you can't even finish the board.
It is bassically E2M1, execpt there are a few more teleports added, plus
some crushing ceilings, plus a few weapons.  We have played it for many,
many hours.
