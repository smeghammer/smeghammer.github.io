Additional Credits	: Rapha‰l Quinet and Brendon J. Wyber for DEU 5.21.
			  Colin Reed for BSP v1.xx (can't DEU without it).
			  Patrix for Deathmatch tutoring and pointing out
			     two nasty LineDefs that I missed.
			  Desdinova for being a swell kind of guy.
			  Myself, for being so clever.
			  And, of course, those guys at id.

Description             : This is the third revision of DANTE'S GATE, and it 
			  accommodates a peculiar bug in the Doom 1.666 engine
			  which does not allow multiple sector tagging for
			  raised floors.  I just barely caught this and had
			  to redo a couple of sectors which raised fine in
			  1.2 through 1.5b, but not in 1.666.  I've also taken
			  advantage of some of the new LineDef and Sector tags
			  for Fast Doors and Lifts.  This version is fully
			  compatible with Doom 1.666. 

			  For the most part, the only "theme" I had in mind was
			  to make the level as aesthetically pleasing and 
			  consistent as possible.  In other words, I wanted it
			  to look neat. There are lots of little nooks and 
			  crannies scattered about, and (I hope) a few
			  surprises.  

			  Please let me know what you think by E-Mail at any
			  of the above addresses.
			  
			  Enjoy. (And if you liked DANTE, check out the 
			  third level in the series, CROSSING ACHERON. The 
			  second level, VIRGIL'S LEAD, will be released after
			  DOOM II.)

Instructions		: Put DANTE666.WAD and DANTES.BAT in your DOOM directory,
			  then "DANTES."  Skill level defaults at "Hurt Me 
			  Plenty."

Disclaimer		: I assume no responsibility for anything of any sort
			  in any way, shape, or form, now, then, henceforeward, 
			  in this life (or the next several) for any screw-ups
			  or even minor inconveniences this PWAD causes you,
			  your family, your relatives, friends, ancestors,
			  associates, employers, pets, neighbors, lovers,
			  deities (major AND minor), nor any other person --
			  living, dead, or undead -- that you have or will ever
			  have any contact with in even the slightest form.
			  This PWAD has been tested and tested ad infinitum, so
			  it shouldn't mess with your computer or anything else
			  remotely associated with it.  But if it DOES, then
			  too damn bad.  Don't come cryin' to me.  It must be
			  something YOU did.

Grammar Lecture		: "a lot" is two words, not one; it's "you're," not
			  "your" -- as in "you are" unless you're (see?) using
			  the possessive in your (uh huh) text descriptions;
			  "their" indicates possession, "there" indicates
			  place or direction.**
