                          Intel, for the 80x86 series of microprocessors            (death to the 680x0 cpu!!!!)
                          My beta guys: Kirk (Ruasikko) Hagberg, 
                          Glenn (dog boy) Sibley, and Dave Seper.

Description             : A huge, fairly straight foreward level that is 
                          shaped like the top portion of a skull.  It's not 
                          all that difficult to complete, but nearly 
                          impossible to find all the secrets.  I have 
                          installed more teleporters than nescessary in order 
                          to allow quick access to various parts in 
                          deathmatches.  There are several areas that 
                          "respawn", not in the sense of NIGHTMARE, 
                          but some places you could kill everything, then 
                          come back later and find some new nasties.
                          This runs fine full or almost full screen on 
                          the 486-33s I've tried it on.  I have no creative 
                          or witty story behind this, except that I learned 
                          that I spent way too much time on this stage.  
                          95% of the textures are aligned the way I want them 
                          (most done before DEU 5.2), so don't yell about the  
                          few bad ones.  I have a bunch of new ideas for new
                          levels, so this should not be my last stage.  Also
                          look for my ray-traced robotic sentries (sentry.zip)
                          they replace the cacodemons.

* Construction *
============================================================================

Base                    : New level from scratch
Build Time              : 90-100 hours on the map only, not including testing 
                          the map and getting the sound and graphics to work. 
Editor(s) used          : DEU 5.0, DEU 5.1, DEU 5.2gcc, DEU 5.21gcc, 
                          BSP 1.0, and BSP 1.1x
Known Bugs              : In the noze, there are a few spots where it flickers, 
                          I think it's beacuse of the 1000 unit drop.  I'd 
                          appreciate any input on how to fix this.
