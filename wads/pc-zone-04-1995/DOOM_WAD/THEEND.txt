New PWAD for DOOM: THEEND.WAD

I designed this level specifically for me and my friends, who like the final 
level in multiplayer games to be a blast-fest with lots of monsters (you
know, "the final" battle).  For others who like levels where your primary
opponent is monsters, this is for you.  As in all my levels, this is 
"professionally" designed (wall textures align properly, careful choice
and variety of room settings, exits labelled, ammo/supplies placed prudently
etc.).

For those who like more intricate levels with several obstacles/traps, keep
an eye open for TOWN.WAD, which is in final test phases and should be 
released in about 1 week.
