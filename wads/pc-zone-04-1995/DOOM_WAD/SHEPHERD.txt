Misc. Author Info       : I am a Registered Professional
                          Engineer (Civil/Structural) at the
                          Idaho National Engineering Laboratory
                          (INEL) - A DOE Nuclear Research Site
                          and the birthplace of nuclear 
                          generated electrical power.
                          I live in Rigby, Idaho; the
                          birthplace of TV (ie..CRT).

Description             : This is my first PWAD and while not  
                          the most flashy, it is solid. As far 
                          as I know it has none of the STUPID   
                          door and texture mismatches that make
                          me want to scream and flame the author.
                          Also, I kept it under a 100K and 
                          didn't include any CyberDemons or
                          Spiders.

Additional Credits to   : Brittany - my daughter (5 years old)   
                          for playtesting the easiest difficulty
                          setting. 
                          Ed A. - my DeathMatch playtester and 
                          whipping boy!
