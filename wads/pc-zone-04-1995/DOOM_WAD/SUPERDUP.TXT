SUPER-DUPER Dehacked patch:

Okay, admitteedly these are all kinda lame, but if anyone's still listening,
this patch changes three weapons:

Rocket Launcher = Grenade Launcher  (See GRENADE.DEH)
Plasma Rifle = Air-blast stungun. This rapid-fire burst of air will hold
                enemies firmly in place.
BFG900 = Decoy Mine Dropper. Drops rocket mines that look like power-ups!
         Fool your friends! Frag your enemies!

This is only a patch I wrote to learn about changing weapons. If anyone likes
these, or can think of neat-o modifications, e-mail me.
