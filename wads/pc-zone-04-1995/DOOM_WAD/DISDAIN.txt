Misc. Author Info       : Well, let's see, I'm a single 24 yr. old male, I
                          like DOOM, tattoos, caffeine, and cigarettes. BLAH,
                          BLAH, BLAH, BLAH......

Description             : There's not much of a story to this .WAD, I built
                          it mostly for challenging architecture and just
                          plain blood and carnage. ;) It (I think) would
                          be fun for Deathmatch play, so let me know what
                          you think.

Additional Credits to   : B. Wyber & R. Quinet for DEU, C. Reed for BSP,
                          Dr. Sleep for tips and encouragement, Marc, Joe,
                          and John for testing.

Notes: This is the second .WAD that I've put up for the world to see, "Fury"
being the first.  I personally think this one is better because I tried to 
use architecture and textures more creatively.  Please E-mail me your 
comments, suggestions, and/or criticism(constuctive please).  Feedback is
VERY helpful! I really don't mind meeting new people<g>
thanx
