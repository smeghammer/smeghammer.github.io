Description             : This is a level which was originally
          intended to be a simple copy of our flat. Our flat proved
          to be very boring so I added a subterranian section. This
          does not have to be explored to complete the level. There
          are some areas that were specifically added for deathmatch
          play but these don't detract from single player mode.
          Our flat number is 692, this is not version 6.92

* Construction *

Base                    : New level from scratch.
Build Time              : Many moons.
Editor(s) used          : DEU5.1, DEU5.21 & IDBSP10.
Known Bugs              : It is possible to see a small flash of
          sky below the mountains when standing on a window ledge.
          I'm prepared to live with this as I really wanted a small
          fence rather than a tall one. The Cell Pack that appears
          in the largest room is not a bug. I know how to stop the
          effect but decided not to.
