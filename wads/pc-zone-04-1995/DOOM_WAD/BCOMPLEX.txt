This was supposed to be a small wad but somehow it got to be 180k for 
one level.  This is a great deathmatch & multiplayer level, but it is
also possible to win solo.  All weapons can be found on this level +
extra health etc.  The Cyberdemon also exists on this level, but only
comes out if you push a certain marked button.

Distribute and modify this level to your hearts content.
