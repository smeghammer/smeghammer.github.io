Description             : So you think you're the best, eh?
                          So you think that because you've killed the 
                          two barons in the first map, you're invincible.
                          Think again, cadet, you ain't seen NOTHING.

                          I've tried to make this map as challenging as 
                          possible both intellectually and during play.
                          There are a couple puzzles in here that will get
                          you thinking.  I designed this level so that it
                          will be VERY hard to pass on the 1st try.  It is
                          VERY possible that you can get stuck and have to
                          start the level over.  Save often!

                          (Especially East of the Main courtyard.)

                          Also, when playing the more difficult levels, DOOM
                          may exit with an allocation error because of the
                          # of things on the map.  If you have 4 Mb, stick to
                          settings 1-3.
