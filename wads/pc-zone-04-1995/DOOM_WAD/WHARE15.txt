*   misc info   *

This is actually a wharehouse where I worked as a temp last week...well, there
weren't as many undead soldiers with guns and I couldn't find the red key....
There are two main rooms and two "death-machines." (I'm proud of those)  The
first one is actually setup where the carpet-rolling machine was that I worked
with, but I'm sure you care.  I haven't really tested it with multiplayer
since 1.5 is the only version fast enough to use with a null-modem connection
and it won't load external files in the shareware version...oh, well.  It
should be fun though, with pleanty of dark nooks and crannies and open spaces
to hide, dodge, or cower in.  Check out the boss's office...he's checkin'
over a bit of damaged shipment.  There's no gratuitous use of powerfull baddies
and enough health to keep you kicking if you're carefull.  

This is #5 in a whole episode I hope to create by the end of summer...I've
released #3 already (styfst13.zip Stay Frosty) I'd like to hear any comments 
and or suggestions on either of the two levels....

*   rights and privilages   *

Authors may NOT use this as a base to create new levels (It's mine and
you can't have it!)  You can do anything else with it as long is this file
is included and/or I'm mentioned somewhere.  Any problems occuring from the
use of this wad (mental trauma, water on the knee, rectal itch, ear mites) are
yours and yours alone, I don't wanna hear about it.  

But seriously...enjoy the wad 'cause I had fun making it.
