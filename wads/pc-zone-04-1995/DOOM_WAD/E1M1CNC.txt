Hi all!
   This is our (Chris Burton and Chris Straw) contribution to the doom pwad 
pool.  Hope you enjoy it.
   It's quite the challenge on ultraviolent level! Hehe :)  I've played 
extensively on the modem.  It's great if I do say so myself.  
   I haven't tried it with -respawn yet or in NIGHTMARE mode either cause I 
don't think I can beat it.  It might be interesting to put it on Hurt me 
Plenty or something and try it with netdoom with -respawn....   
Hmmmmmmm... oh well cya l8r, I gotta go... yeah that's the ticket!
