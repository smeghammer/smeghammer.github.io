WADPAK1a.WAD by Gary Karnik (g.karnik@att.com)

This is the second release WADPAK1. This is my attempt to take some of
the best shareware PWADs for DOOM available and combine them together
into reasonable new episodes. Each episode should be playable by a
single player or deathmatch as in ID's own levels.

Play using "doom -file wadpak1a.wad" (you must have the registered version).

This is the source for this new wad pak:

EPISODE1:              EPISODE2:               EPISODE3:
