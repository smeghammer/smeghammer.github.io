After long months of editing and revising and playing......I finally finished 
the layout for my first sewer level..........

Players:1-4, DM
Levels:E1m1
Skills:yes
New graphics:no
Music:not yet
File size:about 283K
Save?: no, but on Doom 1.6

Although there's lots of monsters in some areas, there are ways to get rid of 
them easily.....just have to figure it out. Some puzzles here and there, the 
level is also easier on one player then 2 player. This is just the first of 5 
or 6 levels.


Story..........
		Once upon a time........you (and your buddy, if playing 
		modem) are the only ones who made it inside the sewer 
		entrence while the rest of the guys are behind and can't get 
		in.....so its up to you to clean out the sewage and find a 
		way to get you out. You will be going through different 
		sewers, from water to sewage to getting through lava. 
		(on this one, only the water part was complete.) Have fun! 


please give me comments, good, bad, or obscene. When playing 2 player, besure 
to be fair in equipments cause there's enough for both of ya. ( take it al 
for your self! >:) )

Thanks to DEU and BSP.
