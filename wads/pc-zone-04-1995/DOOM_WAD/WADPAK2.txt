WADPAK2.WAD by Gary Karnik (g.karnik@att.com)

This is my second attempt to take some of the best shareware PWADs for
DOOM available and combine them together into reasonable new episodes.
Each episode should be playable by a single player or deathmatch as in
ID's own levels.

This is the source for this new wad pak:
