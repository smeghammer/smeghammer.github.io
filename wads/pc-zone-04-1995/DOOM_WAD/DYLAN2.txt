DYLAN2.ZIP contains DYLAN2.WAD which is a BRAND NEW WAD file
created with beta 4 of DEU 5.

Play it in deathmatch or single player (this map is meant for
hardened players).


DOOM -FILE dylan2.wad  (play episode 1, mission 1)

If you have already played dylan1.wad, this is a modified version
which includes an exit level (somewhere) and also a couple of secrets.
I also put the bfg on the map for good measure.
