Description             : Should be OK on 486/33 SX or DX 
                          with 8 MB RAM, and a zippy video card.
                          
                          
                          Quite a large level with lots to kill and a few
                          puzzles to solve. I played it a couple of times 
                          so I know it can be done. Unfortunately, there's 
                          a couple of small areas where the mirroring effect
                          persists, and I just couldn't get rid of it!
                          I'm not going to tell you to be careful and save 
                          the game often etc etc, cos you'll play it your 
                          own way anyhow.

                          I had a lot of fun creating this, I hope you enjoy 
                          playing it.
