Description             : This PWAD is the First level of my SHORES OF HELL
                          replacement mission. I am releasing it as a single
                          level for the sole reason to get feedback and
                          comments on my design/implementation so I can
                          make the other 8 even better! This is my first
                          attempt at a PWAD so be gentle!

EXTREMELY IMPORTANT!!  Make *SURE* Gamma Correction is OFF!! You will be MISSING
                       the essence of the "feel" I have tried to convey here.
                       DOOM is a dark and forboding place with dimly lit areas,
                       dangerous shadows and sounds. turn out the lights and
                       ENJOY!!

Additional Credits to   : Mr Geoff Allan. Creator and author of DOOMeD.
                          Without his program and assistance this would just
                          be DEU-DOO (*JUST KIDDING!!*) I was glad to be one
                          of the alpha testers for DOOMeD and I wore him
                          out with questions and such. Thanks also to
                          Dave Bruni. Fellow Alpha tester and author of
                          the DOOMeD tutorial(s) He helped along with Geoff
                          to play test this thing for me.
