* Construction *

Base                    : New levels from scratch, except E1M8,
                          for which I used id Software's "Phobos
                          Anomaly" as a base.
Editor(s) used          : DEU 5.2.1; BSP 1.0; REJECT 1.0
Known Bugs              : Nifty "hall-of-mirrors" effects in nearly
                          half the walls (shouldn't slow down game
                          play); players not allowed to pick up guns
                          or ammo; and many of the imps, for reasons
                          I can't explain, look remarkably like Gabe
                          Kaplan, TV's "Kotter." :D
Words                   : I would like to thank everyone listed in 
                          the "Additional Credits" section.  With-
                          out their input and support, I would have
                          stopped building after E1M3.  I would also
                          like to thank PCC Jon and PC Sylva at AOL.
                          Their kindness and patience have been a
                          blessing, to say the least.  And, most
                          importantly, I'd like to thank all the 
                          members of on line services who downloaded
                          these maps individually.  I hope you'll
                          enjoy playing these as a coherent episode.
                          This is the end of my Doom map-building
                          career.  I'm proud to announce, I've been
                          offered the opportunity to work with 
                          Apogee Software as a contributor to one of 
                          their upcoming 3-D games. :D
