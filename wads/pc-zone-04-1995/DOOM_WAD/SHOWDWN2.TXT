SHOWDWN2.WAD
================================================================

From Rick DeMar's Original SHOWDOWN!

I couldn't have been more impressed or addicted to real brow bending
action in a PWAD until  I ran across Rick DeMar's SHOWDOWN.WAD file.
Even though the original PWAD needed some adjustments, it really was
a SHOWDOWN indeed! With express permission from Rick DeMar via Email
I am releasing this  PWAD as  SHOWDWN2.WAD which  contains  two more
steps to  getting out of the  literal blood-bath SHOWDOWN originally
contained. Rick DeMar's balance of a small map with mega monsters is
really  great as this will allow it to run smoothly when at the very
peak of the battle. I hope you enjoy playing and  YES there are many
ways to beat this map, it's all just a true matter of your attitude.

Enjoy,

Vance Andrew Blevins

P.S. This PWAD plays GREAT in Cooperative mode! Deathmatch feels just
     about like playing cooperatively! UV+ mode? I don't think so....
