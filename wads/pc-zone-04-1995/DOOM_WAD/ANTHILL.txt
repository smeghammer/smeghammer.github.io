anthill.wad
E1M1 solo  (deathmatch may crash).

This wad is based on the student center
and campus pub at the Univ. of California, 
Irvine (U.C.I). This is the anthill pub 
that went $235,000 dollars in debt selling
beer on a college campus?  How? Unknown.

As far as I can tell, the cybodemon must be 
killed with the BFG9000 at skill 4.

It is certainly not the most difficult but it
is challenging enough to be interesting.

These WADS take way too much of this grad students
time, so feel free to alter/distribute/ignore or
otherwise use these as you see fit.
