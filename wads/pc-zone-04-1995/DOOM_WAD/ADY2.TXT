ADY2.WAD
--------
DOOM! PWAD Created by Adrian Speight in the Summer of 94
I hope this is fun for you to play. I enjoyed making it

Please do NOT use it as a basis for other levels - I design
my levels as complete ideas and not building blocks

Replaces E1M1 - registered version only due to weapons

Skill levels ARE implemented
Works well in single player - very difficult though without IDKFA
Works well in Cooperative play - very well in fact - mega hard traps
Not an ideal deathmatch level, but there ARE deathmatch starts
Works best on a FAST 486 - I try and write fast levels but this
one is quite BIG

Ady2.wad - A more ambitious level with lots of special effects and traps
and hopefully some surprises and atmosphere. Ideal for Coop play, and a
challenge to beat without any deaths even in 4 player. 
There are some (hopefully) impressive traps and visuals too.
Sorry if you dont have a fast machine or multiplayer facility.
