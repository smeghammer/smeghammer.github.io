Get ready to experience true FEAR!
FEAR21   (episode 2 level 1)

warning! this is an ADVANCED level !  
It plays well in multi player mode and features some nasty adversaries
in some very interesting tactical environments.
Fear21 has been well tested in both multiplayer and single modes,and if
played skillfully, you will have all the equipment and ammo you (and your 
group) will need to leave this horror alive.
This level was designed to be exciting and challenging for advanced players
even /especially when the player is familiar with the layout, so if you
keep getting creamed at first, try a lower difficulty level until you
know the layout better.  Have fun!
