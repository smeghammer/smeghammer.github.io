Description             : Sort of an "Unholy Chapel".
                          (Is it going to be a "White Wedding?")

                          Q. What do ya get when you cross
                             a Demon with a Cacodemon?
                          A. I dunno, but hand me that rocket
                             launcher, 'cause here it comes!
