             MY TWO CENTS..................


Fellow DOOMers,

From the beginning I have had one goal and one goal only: To create a level
(well... MISSION) that is as consistent and detailed as the original game.

 I personally feel that its critical to have as cohesive and consistent design
in such that you could literally play a PWAD then continue into the very next
original DOOM level and it would be a natural progression. Totally seamless.

 One of the truly remarkable things about DOOM is that you could be tiptoing
down a dark hall and then out of the black... FIREBALL!  and you DUCK! flinging
your head away from the screen to avoid being hit.That is realism, engrossing
the player in the enviornment.Id has taken us to "the next level" of realism.
No fancy video on CD, just great DESIGN.I can only dream to be as good at it
as Id but I strongly feel that we must strive in our level design to continue
that same realism,engrossing the player in whatever "feel" or atmosphere you
are trying to convey,to tell a story of the marines hell fight to get through!

In My level(s), The cohesiveness I talk about is the same as DOOM itself.
If you go back to the DOOM README and read the descriptions of secret rooms,ect
my level is the same.look for the same clues. One other thing you might have
noticed in DOOM itself is that most of the time you dont get things,weapons,
ammo,ect, until you NEED them. And if it looks like a trap, it probably is.

 I did not include the part in WAD_AUTH.TXT about "setting the mood" because
Id did not tell you BEANS about any level before you went in,so I AINT EITHER!

And PLEASE save those PWADS to *ANY* level exept E1M1! Fully 75-80% of the 150+
PWADS I have played just used the "default" and us poor saps with sound cards
have to listen to the same darn music over and over. I will usually sit down
and play 3-4 per day (that is until i started this mess) and after the a while
that music gets OLD!

 I am no expert, and this IS my first level, but nonetheless I tried very hard
to make it as I have stated above. There are many exeptional authors out there.
People I can only hope to achieve the quality of work that they have done.
But I will try....... and to the budding authors out there I hope you do too.

 As beginning levels go (that is eXm1) this one is a little big.The originals
are all smaller than 100k but you are here because you beat DOOM to death and
you need more (read difficult) challenges. Remember though, this IS the first
level of a MISSION and therefore it is not super hard as it is part of a bigger
picture, (levels 2-9). I have outlined each and every one Im building and how
they all tie together AS A GROUP when played as a mission.so on its own this
level cannot be compared with a "complete" type level where it stands on its
own to be played as only one "game" as it were. This is only the ground floor.

 I do want comments. It means a lot to hear from players. There was a fine
TXT file put out recently which REVIEWED some of the PWADS in circulation.
And it was a real eye opening experience for me.Great stuff to hear from the
players as to what they want, like, hate, whatever.

That said, lets cut the chat and slap some lead!!

(soapbox off)
