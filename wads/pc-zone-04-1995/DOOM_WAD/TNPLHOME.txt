Description             : You're sitting back in your easy chair
                          relaxing by the fireplace and watching a 
                          star trek rerun on the tube when you get
                          this eerie feeling.  You look around the
                          room which now seems unfamiliar and a 
                          horrible realization comes upon you... 
                          This isn't your house!  
                          There's a strange noise coming from the 
                          kitchen and slowy, carefully you go...

* Miscellaneous Information *

This wad started off as an experiment with this idea: "Hmm. I wonder
if I could make something that looks like a fireplace?"  I then
decided to see if I could make a wad that gives the appearance
of being in a Multifloor level *without* the use of teleports.
Unless you're paying real close attention, I think I've done it.
Ok, I did use one teleport.  It was the only way to jump from
this one certain spot to another but it's not required that you
use it.
