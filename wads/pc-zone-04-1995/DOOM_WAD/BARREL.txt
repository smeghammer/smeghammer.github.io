Description             : 

                          "No.... please.  Not the Barrel!  Anything
                           but the Barrel..  No!  Not the Barrel!
                           Not the Barrellllllll!"

                          Welcome to Barrel - I hope it gives you
                          nightmares.  Certainly, if you have a
                          machine slower than a 486 then you take
                          your chances with this WAD as a few areas
                          have quite complex detail.

                          I certainly had fun making this one (and
                          playing it).  You'll find a couple of
                          references to Scream.Wad - so if you've
                          played that, it might help.  Then again
                          it might not.

                          As usual, this *can* be done without cheating.

                          Any problems - email me.

                          strange thoughts - especially about acid and
