Description             : X-Rated  This wad may be considered X-rated
                          by some.  In my opinion, the nude shot in the 
                          bedroom is no more X-rated than the violence of
                          the game.  If it offends you don't play this wad.
                          
                          This was my home and horse farm...until a UAC
                          C147 attempting to land at Dulles Airport, which I 
                          unfortunately happen to be under the N-S approach,
                          crashed here.  I'm not sure what happened but
                          but apparently the C147 was carrying Toxic waste from
                          the Spawning Pits which upon landing on my land began
                          mutating all the animals who began spawning in my 
                          house, barns and out-buildings. In addition, 
                          the plants became mutated.... 
                          well to make a long story short I'm fucked unless you
                          can save the farm.

* Play Information *

* Installation *

Unzip everything into your Doom directory.  Run the batch file getsur.bat 
which will place new things into your main doom.wad .  There is a batch file
called getorig.bat which will put the things back as they were.  The wad will
run fine without doing this but you will see red and green columns instead of 
the cool cactus and desert trees.  Also included is a copy of dmgraph.exe which
puts the things into and out of the main wad.  This is the only way I know of
to get thingy's to you.  They will not transfer in a pwad.
You may want to zip up a copy of your original doom.wad before doing this in
case it scares you, otherwise all you have to do if you goof up is re-install
the game.

Known Bugs              : Will play slowly on 386 40 machines. 
                          Developed on 486 66.  Idbsp node builder makes it
                          run much better on the slower machines, you should 
                          of seen it before Idbsp.exe on a 386 40.

Other: Using a difficulty levels less than UltraViolent decreases the number
       of baddies outside the house which speeds the gameplay on slower machines.  
       I hope you enjoy this as much as I enjoyed making it.
