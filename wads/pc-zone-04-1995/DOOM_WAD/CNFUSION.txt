Description             : I made this wad file right after I discovered DEU,
                          the almighty doom level editor. This is an experi-
                          mental level for me. I made it as I was learning 
                          DEU and its how to. This is why there is no general
                          theme to this wad ( Hence the name confusion). I 
                          will make my future pwad files with a general theme 
                          in mind. I would hope that you enjoy this level. 
                          I would also greatly appreciative if you could drop 
                          me a line and let me know what you thought of this 
                          wad (Good or Bad). If there were any concept, rooms 
                          and or ideas you liked or disliked.

                          This level contains a few wall which you can walk
                          through as well as hidden doors. There is plenty
                          of ammo, but you should use it wisely!
