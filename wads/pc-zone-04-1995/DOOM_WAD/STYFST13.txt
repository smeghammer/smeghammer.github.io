Description             : You step quickly out of the Gate and  
                          quickly grab Ole' Besse, your faithful
                          shotgun.  You open the door and step out
                          into the corridor with the feeling you're
                          entirely alone....

* Suggestions *

I would advise installing some of the Star Wars patches before playing
this wad (although its certainly not mandatory). Specifically the
ones that replace the f_sky texture with a star field and the cacodamons
with Probots.  I've never tried this wad without the star field, so
I don't know if any HOM bugs would be caused by the normal f_sky texture.
Keep those Star Wars patches comming!  Plus I advise using DeHakED to
create the "moving barrel" effect because its just a really cool thing to
do.
