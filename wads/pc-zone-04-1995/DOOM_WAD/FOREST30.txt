Version Info            : With ver 3.0, I added a preview level taken
                          from my upcomming OTTAWAU.WAD. It is E2M5,
                          take a look at it!

Description             : Forest is a five mission PWAD with new
                          graphics. Look at the sky and watch for
                          'graphiti' on some walls.
