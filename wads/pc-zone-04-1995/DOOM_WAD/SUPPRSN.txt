STORY...

[ELECTRONIC TRANSMISSION START  Date:2499.7]

From: Chairman Union Aerospace Corporation

-message start-

	Stiff competition in recent years between various space agencies 
has led to the spread of various settlements further out into the solar 
system. Beyond the orbit of Mars lies a large band of various sized chunks 
of rock, some rich in useful extractables such as iron ore, known as the 
asteroid belt. The largest asteroid Ceres is home to a small station 
responsible for administration of the local area. A few weeks ago an 
uprising started there that quickly turned into outright revolt. A 
group of Marines sent in to quell the rebellion instead joined it. Garbled 
radio transmissions made mention of demons taking over the base by 
somehow transforming normal law-abiding citizens into radical anarchists.
	This can't be true can it? I mean, there are no such things as
demons are there? All the same, this represents a serious situation that        
needs attending to immediately. Shuttle Titan is leaving for Ceres from 
gate 17 immediately and I want you on it. Due to interference from
radiation storms the shuttle will not be able to land, you will be
teleported into the main receiving area. Your official job will be to 
go in there and restore order using any means necessary. Unofficially, 
your mission is to lay down suppressing fire in liberal doses, i.e.: 
kick some ass.

P.S. Find out about these so-called demons, maybe we can employ them.

That is all.
