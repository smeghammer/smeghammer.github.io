DESCRIPTION: DOOM PATCH WAD 
FILE: WALKER.ZIP
AUTHOR: CALABRAUN (THE LEY LINE WALKER)
INET ADDRESS: BGESLER@DESIRE.WRIGHT.EDU

This is definatly the wad I have had the most fun building.  I enjoy playing
it for both deathmatch and single play.  It has some good sniping spots, and
weapon placements.  A couple secrets rooms which arn't hard to find.  Some
really nice scenery I enjoyed making.  If you would like to play the author
at this wad, contact me at the above address, but be warned; you will be
playing on my turf! Doom on..
