Misc. Author Info               : I'm SYSADMIN for supercomputing, but prefer
                                  to find new ways to splatter my "friend's"
                                  guts over and over again........

Description                     : Designed for 2 player deathmatch and single
                                  player, a mid-sized level with a few tricks
                                  and secret doors. Employed the use of rising
                                  staircase and crushing ceiling. Essentially
                                  you are confronted with a bunch of mutants
                                  shooting at you from above and behind. There
                                  are a few intersting surprises that will leave
                                  you wondering if the next ambush will come from
                                  the next room or one you just left. Strategic use
                                  of the shotgun and barrels will aid you. If you
                                  discover a secret door (near the start, hint, hint)
                                  without disturbing the wrong monsters, you will
                                  be treated with the opportunity to blast a bastard
                                  out a narrow window, from behind. Very satisfying.
