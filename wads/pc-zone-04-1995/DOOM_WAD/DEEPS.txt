Misc. Author Info       : I am a Computer Systems student in Universidad
                          Iberoamericana, M‚xico. This is my first wad ever,
                          I hope you enjoy it.

Description             : I wanted to put a little of everything on this wad.
                          There are a LOT of remote switches and secrets.
                          Later on I will make some other wads and have a
                          theme for them, but right now I want to know what
                          do you think of this one. I was really careful to
                          avoid HOM and misaligned textures, so if you find
                          anything wrong, please let me know.
