Description             : TheKeep2 is the final update of The-Keep.Wad.
                          The medieval castle has few secrets to give away
                          but playing a deathmatch can be fun.  The chaingun
                          appears to be the weapon of choice in this wad.
                          There are two places now to pick it up.

                          Thekeep2 is a castle with towers, dungeons,
                          and a moat.  It has a good deathmatch or
                          single-player layout.
