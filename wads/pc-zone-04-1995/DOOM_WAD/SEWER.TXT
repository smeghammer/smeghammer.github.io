Description             : The year is 2083. Ever since the discovery of
                          Tachyon Converters in the early 2030's there
                          has not been much use for the old nuclear waste
                          recycling plants. The government turned most
                          of them into low cost housing developments. 
                          Except for Facility 103. It was converted into
                          a prison, an Alcatraz of sorts. A strange mutated
                          version of the flu strain has developed in this
                          prison. The government has sent you and your
                          team to get a sample of the virus. They have
                          given you each a vaccine which should provide
                          immunity to the disease. Yeah, right.. Your team
                          transports to the facility and catches the disease
                          within minutes, making you go berzerk. It then 
                          becomes a free for all, every man for himself.. 
                          a DEATHMATCH!

                          This level is built for deathmatch play, but it 
                          will allow Cooperative & Single Player (would be 
                          boring). Has all the weapons and plenty of ammo 
                          and other goodies, if you can figure out how to 
                          get em...hehehe... Try not to crank up your gamma 
                          correction, it takes away from the suspense of 
                          entering the sewer tunnel. This is my first attempt 
                          at making a WAD, so lemme know if you like it
                          or if you think it stinks...
