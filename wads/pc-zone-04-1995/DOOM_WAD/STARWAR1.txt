Description             : The DEATH STAR!!!  Based on blueprints of a
                          set built for the movie and as well as 
                          information contained in the SW RPG.  This
                          level includes the chasm Luke and Leia 
                          swang across, the elevators Luke, Han, and 
                          Chewie entered on their way to the detention 
                          level (sorry, these don't work, I ran out of 
                          sectors), and the large corridor with the 
                          blast doors.  The blueprints covered 1/6 of 
                          the level, so I had to make up the rest.  
                          This is probably the first of many Star Wars
                          levels I will do, and I will eventually
                          replace this level's textures with my own.
