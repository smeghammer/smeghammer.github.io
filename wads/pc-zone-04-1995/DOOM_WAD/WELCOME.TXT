Would love to hear any comments or suggestions on this map and its structure.
I've tried to make it a real jump in your seat level even though it is not very
big. Secret doors are limited (there are only 2) and their contents are really 
just bonuses and not vital to completing the level. Quite difficult in Skill 4
 but still good if any other skill. Remember to leave a trail of bread crumbs 
because you are going to go in circles......
