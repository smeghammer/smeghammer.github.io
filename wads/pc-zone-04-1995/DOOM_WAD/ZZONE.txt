Description             : This level is designed for DEATHMATCH play.
                          It's a room full of obstacles, lifts, ambush 
                          places and rocket launchers. 
                          
Misc game info          : If you don't like the Cyberdemon and Cacodemons,
                          start Doom with -nomonsters.
                          The lifts (there are two) work by 
                          using one side of them.
