 Here's my latest PWAD. I'd appreciate some feedback...

Title                   : E1M1SAS.WAD

Description             : This level replaces Episode 1, Map 1. It is a 
                          stand-alone level and *NOT* intended to blend in 
                          with the standard DOOM levels. The skill levels 
                          are different than what you may be used to. 
                          "Ultra Violence" is a major monster-fest and   
                          intended only for experienced mouse users. "Hurt
                          Me Plenty" is more comparable to the standard
                          "Ultra Violence". "Hey, Not Too Rough" and that
                          other one are for you wimpy players...
                          
The story, so far:        After months of battling the evil spawn of hell,
                          you have finally fallen in the heat of battle. 
                          As you fade to black, you realize that the final 
                          blow has not come, instead you are being lifted and 
                          carried away... to a dark empty cell, where you are
                          to be imprisoned for eternity! Weeks pass... the
                          cell walls are closing in. The only other sign of
                          life is the guard, who taunts you relentlessly, day
                          after day. This day, as the guard (laughing wickedly)
                          tosses foul, bloody meat scraps at you, you 
                          decide that you can take it no longer. Completely
                          surprising the guard, you lunge at the cell bars,
                          reaching through to wrap your hands around the
                          guard's neck and strangle the life from him. As
                          his body slumps to the ground, you happily claim
                          his pistol and the few ammo clips that he has, 
                          after all, he won't be needing them! But you find
                          no key that will open the cell! You're trapped!
                          Will the guard be missed? What will you do?

* Play Information *

Episode and Level #     : E1M1
Single Player           : Yes
Cooperative 2-4 Player  : 2 players only...
Deathmatch 2-4 Player   : Yeah, but I really didn't design it for this...
Difficulty Settings     : Yes, but read the file description.
New Sounds              : No. Made the file too large.
New Graphics            : No
Demos Replaced          : No. Made the level larger by 100K, so I'll have
                          to do an external one. Expect it shorlty...

* Construction *

Base                    : New level from scratch
Build Time              : If I had 10 dollars for every hour, I could
                          get another decent guitar...
Editor(s) used          : DEU 5.1 & BSP 1.1x
Known Bugs              : Many of the rooms have alot of detail to them
                          and *will* be slow on all but the fastest 
                          computers. Maybe you should upgrade!

                          In some of the more detailed rooms, the player
                          may view too many linedefs at one time,
                          which will cause the HOM effect. These areas are
                          few and far between and not all that noticeable,
                          but *do* exist. To solve the problem, I'd have to
                          butcher my level and that's not gonna' happen! 


* Copyright / Permissions *

Basically, I don't really care what you do with this level, so long as you
include this *ENTIRE* text file, unedited; if you don't include this
unedited text file, I'll flame your name all over the Internet!
