Description:
   This is a big and somewhat simple deathmatch wad (only a few tricks
and traps).  It is made up of all the things I value in a deathmatch
wad.  All the weapons are present, and they are spread out.  The more
powerful the weapon, the harder it is to aquire.  I strategically placed
each item for the new "altdeath" option with Doom 1.4 and above.  If you
play without this option, you will have nothing but weapons to pick up
after the first few minutes of play. 
   In honor of one of my favorite wads (halls1-9), I have included a
cage.  However, the person in the cage is able to see out and defend
himself... at least until he runs out of ammo or gets fragged. 
   The lmp was recorded from my (indigo) point of view.  We made it
before I added the exit, so the ending is a little abrupt.  Nonetheless,
it's a fairly long show.  Enjoy!
