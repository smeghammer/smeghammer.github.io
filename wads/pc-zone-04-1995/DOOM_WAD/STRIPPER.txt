Description:                    No- there are no strippers in this wad, but 
                                I got you to look at this, didn't I?  As
                                long as you got this far, you might as well 
                                play it.  It works best as a deathmatch wad,
                                but it's playable as a single player as well.

                                hate) DEU. Check out his Kurt.zip files --
                                dumb name but great wads.  Also to his wife 
                                Carolyn -- a great wad builder, but needs
                                work at actual Dooming.  Thanks guys.
