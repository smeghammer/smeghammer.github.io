Misc. Author Info   : What? Who cares? 

Description             : Although difficult, this level should get a bit 
                          beyond the 14-year old idea of packing a large 
                          room with tons of ammo and tons of monsters.  There 
                          are some subtleties--secret doors and teleporters 
                          galore (this whole thing supposedly started with 
                          teleporter technology gone wild).  Cheat codes?  
                          They're for wimps--save your game and you'll be 
                          fine...

* Construction *

Base                    : New level from scratch
Build Time              : Oh, somewhere around 24 hours...DoomEd bit the dust 
                          early on in the process and I learned a whole bunch 
                          about DEU because of this. 
Editor(s) used          : Primarily DEU, some early work with DoomED-The Real 
                          Thing (alas, it crashed too many times and now 
                          won't even load) and some work with DCK.

own ideas, the whole world would be a little more interesting.

a way to sell it, a few percentage points of the top would be nice.
