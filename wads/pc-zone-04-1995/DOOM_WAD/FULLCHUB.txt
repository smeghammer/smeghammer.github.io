Episode and Level #     : E3M1
Single Player           : Yes (boring, only implemented to take a look-see)
Cooperative 2-4 Player  : No
Deathmatch 2-4 Player   : Yes (Recommended)
Difficulty Settings     : Yes (To facilitate those who like monsters in there
			       DM levels this level includes varied settings.
			       The easy level has almost none.  Medium a good
			       amount, and hard is just plain ridiculous and
			       unsurvivable for single player).

			  want it to see it.
