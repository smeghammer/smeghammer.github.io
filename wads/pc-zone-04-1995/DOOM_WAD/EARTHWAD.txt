Description             : It's earth, it's home, and it sucks. You expected 
			  a welcome party hosted by friends and family, but 
			  looks like the Hellspawn are hosting this one, and 
			  it ain't a welcome party, it's a sweet goodbye.

			  and the makers of DEU, Dmreal, and BSP. Great 
			  software, guys!
