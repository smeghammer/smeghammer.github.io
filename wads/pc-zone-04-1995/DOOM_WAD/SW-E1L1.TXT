These two .wad files were made simply to view fantastic battles
in the courtyard of Episode 1, Level 1. They were created from the
.wad file of the registered version 1.2 of DOOM. A batch file is
included (SW.BAT) that contains all of the needed command-line
parameters except the .wad name. Unzip the files into your DOOM
directory. Type "SW SW1.WAD" or "SW SW2.WAD" to start DOOM and
include the edited E1L1 file. Then, inside the game, type "IDDQD"
to turn on GOD mode, run over to the courtyard window, fire a few
shots to rile up the crowd, and then watch all the fun!

SW1.WAD
-------

Three Cyber Demons and three Spider Demons. The Cybers won most
of the time I watched, sometimes wiping out all three of the
Spiders without losing a single Cyber. Most of those times the
Spiders won, there would be only a single Spider left standing.
I like to see just how many shotgun blasts it takes to finish the
one boss left standing. Once I dropped a Cyber Demon with only
two shots!

SW2.WAD
-------

One Cyber Demon and one Spider Demon, surrounded by many Barons,
Cacodemons, and Imps. The most common end to this carnage is
several Barons left alive. Sometimes the Cyber is victorious and
sometimes the Spider wins, but it's always fun to watch!

One odd thing I noticed while viewing these battles was that
sometimes the Spider Demon would get "stuck" trying to start
walking or turning. It appeared that each time, some other 
creature was standing on one of its legs! In fact, I once
saw a Baron stand on one of its legs and pound it to death
with dozens of green fireballs without the Spider doing any
shooting at all!

Hope you enjoy the show!
