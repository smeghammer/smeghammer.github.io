This was originally just a setup for a Deathmacth level for myself and
my murder-happy friends. I tried to add in some non-deatmatch
componenets to make it more playable, however.
The basis for this level is that it's a portiuon of my school's
campus(Georgia Tech).
Feel free to add on to it and send me bug reports(I've debugged
extensively, but I'm sure there are more to go).
I only ask that if you add on, you send me mail and let me know where
to find the add on, 'cause I'd be eager to play any
enhancements/changes.
(I'm a bit of a doom addict myself).
It's episode 1 mission 1.
Have at it.
