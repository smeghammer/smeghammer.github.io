DOOM CLSMUSIC.ZIP
  A collection of different music for Doom!
-------------------------------------------
compiled by Michael J. Coyne, umcoyne0@CC.UManitoba.CA
Thanks to Scott Kearney, skott@acs.bu.edu for the idea
	(he put together the first CLASSICS.WAD, get it, it's great).

	Okay, this is a new collection of assorted classical pieces that I put
together for Doom.  Out of respect for Scott's great collection of music for
Episode One, this CLASMUS.WAD replaces the music in Episode 2.
	The composers are assorted, but as in Scott's package, I recommend
playing through the levels first and then taking a peek at who the composers
were.
	Sources for these files range from the Internet collection of MIDIs,
to a number of pieces arranged by a friend and myself (#3, #8 and #9 to be
exact).
	My list of composers is somewhat incomplete; if you can clarify any of
the pieces, let me know.
	Some of these .MIDs were a little quiet... I have increased the volume
on some of them in Cakewalk Pro/Windows v2.0, so that they may be heard.
Others I have left due to varying track volumes and laziness.  You may need
to turn up the music volume for some of the tunes.
	All of these sound great on any General Midi device.  I haven't
listened to them on Soundblaster, so I can't guess what it will end up like
on there... or on any FM device.

Credits go to the original composers of the pieces, and to the mighty DEU,
which I used to combine the .WADS into one.  And of course MUS2PWAD and
MIDI2MUS.  My thanks to the authors of those programs...

Standard disclaimer: distribute as much as you want, but keep it free of charge
and no messing with the .ZIP contents. :)
