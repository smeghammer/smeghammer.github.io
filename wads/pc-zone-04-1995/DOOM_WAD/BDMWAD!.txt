    This wad file contains 9 of the best Netdoom Levels, all reorganized
so that they all play one-after another in Episode 1. The best levels 
were determined by 5 people ranking their top 10 levels. If you would like
to add your vote, go ahead and email me at bmetz@ukelele.gcr.com.
    The Sequence of levels is:
     2-1-\
   /-2-4 |     We wanted to be able to use all 9 levels in order, so I
   | 3-1 | had to do a little editing. 2-8, the second level you play,
   | 2-2 | is actually the secret level. We changed 2-1's exit to go to
   | 3-3 | the secret level(2-8).
   | 1-1 |     2-8 contains a boss;I haven't played these levels, so I'm 
   | 3-5 | assuming that killing him would either end the level or end the
   | 3-8 | mission. In any case, one of the cubes in the courtyard now has
   \-2-8-/ a switch to ednt the level. I have also added LOTS of rockets
           and medical kits since there is a need for them, and it enhances
           DeathMatch play tremendously.
