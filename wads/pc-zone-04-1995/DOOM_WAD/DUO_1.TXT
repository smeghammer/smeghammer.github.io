Description             : Duo_1 is a deathmatch level set in an 
			  abandoned Command & Control Center. There
			  are no monsters here, but your buddy came
			  down with DOOMentia must be hunted down & 
			  killed.  BTW, he will be hunting you too.

			  There a numerous windows, sniper positions, 
                          and the entire complex is ringed with 60 
                          rooms filled with extra ammo, shells, medpacks, 
                          etc.  Two teleporters allow quick transit 
                          between rooms.  Textures are simple to allow
			  quick play (No Cement, or Tekwal slowdowns) 

Additional Credits to   : DoomED, Deu, and DoomCAD authors.  Without them...
