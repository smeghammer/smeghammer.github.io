* Instructions *

Put DM_FLEUR.WAD and DM_FLEUR.BAT in your DOOM directory, then run the
batch file.  This takes you into Doom, chooses the "Hey, Not Too Rough"
skill, and starts the level.  To change the skill level, modify -skill #
in the batch file.

I hope this is as much fun for you to play as it was for me to build. I am
already planning what my second level will look like.

I welcome any comments, criticisms (positive), or help given. I am always
appreciative of anyone who shares knowledge.

Additional Credits      : Lee Dixon for a lot of help, files, programs and
advice... and for putting up with some fairly dumb questions. Geoff Allan,
of course, for an editor that finally makes sense to the way I think. I'm
waiting for that October release Geoff. I want, I want! Also, all the
people who put files on Compuserve that explain what the heck is going on.
You really make this easier than it would be.
