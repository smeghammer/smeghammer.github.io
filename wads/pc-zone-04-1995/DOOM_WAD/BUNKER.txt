Description             : Trapped in the enemy bunker, your only
                          goal is to get out alive.  Such a simple
                          plan, such an impossible feat.

Notes                   : We've seen an influx of DOOM PWADs due
                          to the influx of editors, and they are 
                          progressively getting better and easier,
                          but clay in the hands of a novice still
                          makes mud pies!  I've play tested over 
                          50 such PWADs and it looks like the GOOD
                          DOOM PWADs, ones that feel like they 
                          meet ID's high standards, is going to be
                          less than ten percent.  I'm proud to say
                          that this PWAD has been fully tested, 
                          critiqued, and "debugged".  When you play
                          BUNKER.WAD, you will only ENJOY the 
                          experience because it has been made with
                          CARE!
