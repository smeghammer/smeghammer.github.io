Description     :       So, you feel a little claustrophobic today.
                        Well that's ok.  Afraid of the Dark?  Oh, and
                        screams rattle your nerves.  This is just a little
                        level but has a few surprises. Ok and don't forget
                        to check that map of yours from time to time. I
                        think it will fill in the blacks to the title.
