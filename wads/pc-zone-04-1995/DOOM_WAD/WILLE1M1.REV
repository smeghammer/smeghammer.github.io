Now on with the review, I played on UV as usual...

[The Green clears ... ]

  I quickly glance around me and listen for enemies... hmm...
nothing, Ok then where is my shotgun?  I begin the search for
a decent weapon and some ammo...
  I see that I am in a normal building surrounded by green walls
(who was the decorator in here anyway?), I check each hallway
and see nothing, so I choose one and spin around the corner,
I fire a few rounds into the raggedy looking humans, no harm
done.  I see another door, and what appears to be a hallway,
I better run past it first just in case.. I do and spin,
THERE HE IS, and he's holding MY shotgun!  I riddle him full
of bullets (Yea right, with a pistol) and grab my shotgun as
it is about to hit the ground.  I wipe off the grime from the
previous owner and check the load... only 4 shells left, I need
ammo, but I have a shotgun, I can take on the world now!  I kick
open the door and clear the next room (with green walls, I sure
am getting tired of green!) tucking the shells into my ammo pack,
now I'm ready!
  I'm beginning to wonder if this is going to be another walk
through, or if I'm going to find a challenge here, after searching
the area for secrets I head on though the only door unopened...
a few more doors to choose from, I choose one and find another
door (a green door, in a green room) no monsters... I back out
to check some more.. I'm beginning to get a bad feeling about
this, I don't have many shells...
I begin to %@!^&$!&%$#@*^%&(&^#@#$%^@$#*^&%)(*_(%*^#%$#@&^
  Hmm, what was that, line noise?  I wonder how much just got
cut out... well on with the story.
  I grab the invincibility and kick the switch (mentioned
earlier, weren't you listening?  HeHe), and clean out the green
room, this really is a tough level!
  This was a challenging level, I died several times learning
how to approach each new area, I have seen invincibility on
lot's of levels, including ID's, but never needed them, this
one is a requirement to completing this level!
  I saw no HOM anywhere!  My only gripe is the fact that almost
the entire level is GREEN.  I don't mind green, but come on,
unless there is a reason like you're on a level covered in slime
pits (isn't that why the walls are green?  from slime?).

    Watcher rating for design?
                7
    For a first level...would be 8 with some color.

    Watcher rating for Gameplay?
                10
    I don't know how you could make such a small level
      any more entertaining.
