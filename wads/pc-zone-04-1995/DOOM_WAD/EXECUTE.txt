You have been falsely accused of committing fraud (in the old 
sense, where it means "intention of harm") and are cast into 
the Pitgate of Hell. You have no choice but to go down, past Limbo,
past Carnali, past Violente, and into Fraudulente, and hope
you can find a way out. A spirit hovering reads your mind, and 
says, "No unfortunate being has ever returned from the circles of
Hell, however, there exists a magical suit of armor that can force
open the only way out. This way out, unfortunately requires that you
descend all the way past Fraudulente into Lucifer's domain, and find
the armor to escape." He adds, "Find this, escape, and you will have
proven thine innocence."
