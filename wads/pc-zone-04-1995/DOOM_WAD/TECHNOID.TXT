*****************   WELCOME TO TECHNOID.WAD V1.0 ****************************

Mutant TechNoid (Technical Nerds) theme.  Lots of computer looking textures.

Based on an earlier wad (techno.wad) I included in the rickdoom.wad which has
some of my first attempts at using DEU.

Getting the yellow key can be a bit of a trick, and getting the red one can
be dangerous, especially on ultimate or nightmare (if you dare!!).;-)

This level has some doors that are tricky to find or open.  Unfortunately, you will
have to find them and open them in order to leave.

Like the original e1m3, there are two exits: one to e1m4 and one goes to e1m9 
(secret military base level).

There is a trap near the exit to e1m4.  If you fall into it (hint hint), you will
not die, but you will start level e1m4 with <= 10% of your health left.

I still think this would make a good deathmatch level.  The process for exiting 
is complicated enough to discourage early exits, and all of the goodie (weapons)
are in areas away from the exits.

There are some "un-armoured" walls in this level.  These are walls that will stop 
bullets and shot, but not rockets or fireballs.  Makes for some interesting ambush
strategy.  

I may still add more to the outdoor corridor.  Right now there is not much there.


Have fun!

Rick
