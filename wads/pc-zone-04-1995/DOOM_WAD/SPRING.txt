Description             : On a remote, class M planet, is a colony, established
                          to manage an uncommon source of fresh water, a site
                          known as Wellsping. The infection of Wellspring, by
                          the evil minions of Satan has resulted in the seizure
                          of the pumping plant. The plant's water and power are
                          being used to clone members of the hoard. Now the
                          colony is without life sustaining water and the evil
                          side is polluting the only source of water in this
                          sector. Your mission is clear, teleport in, eradicate
                          the evil, and restore the operation of the pumping
                          station. If so much as one evil spore remains, your
                          mission is a failure
