Description             : I designed this level specifically for deathmatch.
			  It is small enough so that won't have trouble
			  finding your opponent, but it is complex enough
			  to provide some variety. There are no easy 
			  suicides, and the weapons are spread around
			  so a player can't monopolize them. I
			  had a blast playtesting this one. There's
			  nowhere to hide, so get ready to run!
