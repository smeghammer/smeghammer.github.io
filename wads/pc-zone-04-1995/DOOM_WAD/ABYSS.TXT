Abyss - a pwad for your enjoyment by Avery Lodato.

This wad replaces E1M1.

A few notes:
  1)  I think that I got most of the bugs out of this level, but there
are still a few problems that I can't track down.
    a>at the very begining of the level if you stand on the border
between the first couple of sectors, the screen will somtimes 
insert a black frame or two.
    b>the star room with the blue keycard has caused my computer to
crash on two occasions.  there is a lot going on in this room, but
I still don't understand exactly what is causing the problem. (I think
that i was using the iddqd cheat both times)

  2)  This is a hard level, but I know that it's not impossible
because I finished it myself (with no cheats, but repeated saves)

  3)  I had plans for much more, but I am sick of working on this level.
I don't think that I'll do another level until the next generation of
level editors is released, it can be a frustrating experience to know
that what you want to do _should_ be possible but can't be made to work.
