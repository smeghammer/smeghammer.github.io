                          E1M2 requires you to raise some stepping
                          stones to get to the exit. Each stepping

This is shareware I guess. 

  Any comments would be great and will help me design better levels
My aim is not to produce huge levels, but rather to have the sizes
roughly proportional to ID's own levels.

  BTW I am a struggling Uni student, if someone was so pleased with
the work I was doing that they sent me money, I would NOT be offended.
;-)

Authors may use this level as a base to build additional
levels but only if they change it heaps and still give me credit.  
(and leave permissions open do that I can do the same to your work).

You MAY distribute this WAD, provided you include this file, 
unmodified.  You may distribute this file in any electronic
format (BBS, Diskette, CD, etc) as long as you include this file 
intact.

* Where to get this WAD *

FTP sites: infant2.sphs.indiana.edu  in /pub/doom/wads/
           
    until it is moved to the proper directory, look for the file 
    SIMON10.ZIP in the incoming directories.
