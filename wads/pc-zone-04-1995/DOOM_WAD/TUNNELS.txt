Misc. Author Info       : This is just a simple Deathmatch level.

Description :             Simple little level with no where to hide! One
                          center chamber with three exits that all
                          connect at one point or another! A teleport in
                          the center of the room moves you to the exit.
                          I've also included some barrels (he he) and
                          two Lava pits where you can commit suicide.
                          BUT: Be warned! Once in the pit, you can't get
                          out until you're dead!

                          I made this because I was sort of tired of the
                          big levels where you had a million hiding
                          places, and I wanted to have something where
                          you would have a quick and exciting deathmatch
                          game!
