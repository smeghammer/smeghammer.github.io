Background              :

You pull back on the throttle and begin your decent.  Below, the Io
military special projects base appears peaceful.  You know otherwise.
High Command lost contact with the secret outpost several weeks ago and
dispatched the spacecruiser STALWART to investigate.  Failing to
establish direct-contact communications, it has become your duty to
journey down to Io and assess the situation.

During your mission briefing, High Command revealed some disturbing
information to you concerning problems with the now defunct UAC bases on
Mars.  H.C. gave no details, mentioning a highly classified project that
"didn't quite work out as expected".  All they would say is that you
should exercise extreme caution when approaching Io, as similiar
research was in progress there (The Apocalypse Project).

As you thumb the retro-thrusters on, you notice a lot of commotion near
the landing pad.  You breathe a sigh of relief, glad that at least
everyone appears to be all right.  Their transmitter is probably down.
You reach for the com link to radio STALWART to send down a tech team . . .

Your shuttlecraft lurches violently.  You drop the com link and grab the
controls, trying in vain to bring the craft back in line.  No use -
you've lost engine control.  Your ship is all ablaze.  You focus all of
your strength and concentration, willing your ship to crash/land near
the landing pad, where help will be quickly available.  With a
ear-splitting cacophany of tearing metal, your shuttle comes to a rest.
You fight to maintain consciousness, moving through the flames and smoke
toward the hatch.  It opens up, letting in the feeble light of a sun
hundreds of millions of miles away. You stumble through.  Coughing
violently, you look up and see . . .

"WHAT IN THE HELL . . .?!"

You fall unconscious.

You awake, only to find yourself alone in a gloomy prison cell.  From
the looks of the decaying bodies around you, the chances of rescue look
slim. However, you didn't get into special forces by depending on others
to solve your problems.  A few minutes later when a guard walks by your
cell, you reach out and grab the poor fool, instantly breaking his neck.
You take his pistol, and begin your fight to freedom . . .

Mission Seques
Mission 2         : You've managed to escape imprisonment, only to
                    discover that the Io base has been completely
                    overrun by the enemy.  And where are the thousands
                    of personnel who were stationed here?

Mission 3         : You've routed the enemy, and they've retreated into
                    the underground waste disposal system. However, you
                    can find no trace, dead or otherwise, of the men and
                    women who were stationed on Io.  Alone, and without
                    transport or communications, you're only chance to
                    make it off this rock anytime soon is to give chase
                    to the demons, in hopes of locating the missing Io
                    personnel.

Mission 4         : You've battled it out with the forces of evil down
                    in the treacherous waste disposal system beneath the
                    Io base, and kicked their collective asses.  But
                    you've only won a small victory - and the bad guys
                    are looking to even the score.  As you walk through
                    the pressure door and emerge from the sewers, you
                    find yourself in a large underground cavern.
                    Exhausted and wounded, you gather your courage and
                    determination and prepare to face your toughest
                    challenge yet.  If you are to have any hope of
                    surviving this ordeal, you must take the greatest
                    leap of your life - and plunge into THE ABYSS.

Mission 5         : You have arrived at the doorstep to hell, and the
                    mat does not say "Welcome".  You are between
                    dimensions, no longer in your own universe, but not
                    yet in that evil place.  The gateway to hell is just
                    around the corner, but first, you must defeat the
                    maze.  Who would have thought hell would be this
                    hard to get into?

Mission 6         : Finally - you've reached your destination: HELL. You
                    drop through the dimensional gate and find yourself
                    on a mountain.  The air is hot and humid, the sky
                    filled with a thick blood-red smoke.  You scramble
                    up the hot, rocky slope to the crest of the
                    mountain.  And you see it - the great Palace of Hell
                    - and you lose all hope.  Amassed at its gates is
                    the largest army you have ever seen assembled:
                    thousands of imps, demons, and barons . . . you'll
                    never defeat them all.  Looks like all your effort
                    has been for naught . . . The rock beneath your feet
                    shifts as a temor rattles the mountain.  The ground
                    crumbles beneath you, and you slide down the
                    mountainside. With a bone-shaking THUMP, you land in
                    a small crevice in the mountainside, just missing a
                    deadly landing on a brown stub.  Slowly, you pick
                    yourself up.  Doesn't appear to be anything broken .
                    . . say, what's that behind that tree??

Mission 7         : You've learned the fate of the personnel from Io,
                    and now it's no longer a matter of survival - it's a
                    matter of revenge.  But before you can seek out the
                    pit boss of this particular hell, you have to find
                    some way of sealing the front gate to prevent his
                    vast army of darkness from coming to his aide.

Mission 8         : You're almost there - you can feel it in your bones.
                    Ahead is the antechamber to the throne room, where
                    the demon has stockpiled his treasures. You wonder -
                    what kind of hideous being would be trusted to
                    defend the WAGES OF SIN??

Mission 9         : You climb the stairs for what seems an eternity.
                    Finally, a door appears up ahead. You wonder what
                    kind of abomination you'll find on the other side...

                          But seriously:
                          One HOM in mission 1
                          Two HOM's in mission 2
                          It is possible to trap yourself in mission 3

                          Many, many bad wall textures in mission 4, due
                          to oversized sectors.  However, most of these
                          are concealed by the fact that you can't reach
                          the walls.  They are surrounded by a river of
                          lava, and to keep people from killing
                          themselves in long, treacherous falls into the
                          lava, I have inserted several impassable lines
                          (conveniently, these lines also conceal 99% of
                          the bad walls).  There are still bad walls (I
                          believe the effect has been dubbed the "veil"
                          effect), and only one or two HOM's.  Overall,
                          I do not think it affects play much.  But, if
                          you are one of those types who can't stand
                          HOM's or bad walls, then I advise not playing
                          this wad.

                          One HOM in mission 5, plus a door that takes a few
                          tries to open.

                          One HOM in mission 8
