Misc. Author Info       : I'm a sofware engineer, obviously with
                          far too much spare time on my hands.

Description             : Mutants have invaded the computer
                          core area!  Clean them out, and don't
                          forget to check the ventilation ducts.
                          This level was originally designed for
                          deathmatch play (if you have three or
                          more players, chainsaw jousting is a
                          sure bet on startup...) but it works
                          quite well for single player use also.
                          I've included my favourite bits from
                          a number of different levels.
