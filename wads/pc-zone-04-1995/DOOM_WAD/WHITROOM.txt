Misc. Author Info       : This is my 2nd PWAD, hope you enjoy
                          it. I have learned more about texture size
                          and placement since the last one.

Description             : E1M1 replacement PWAD. Named for the colour
                          of the exit room.

Additional Credits to   : Authors of DEU and BSP, MIDI2MUS, and

Editor(s) used          : DEU 5.1, BSP 1.1x, WDMSTR05, MIDI2MUS 
Known Bugs              : One room rendered the HOM effect for no reason
                          and so had to be deleted. Still gives some
                          residual problems (such as lowering the
                          ceiling in another sector). I could not seem to
                          get rid of the problem, however, if your avoid
                          opening the door involved (this door doesn't
                          lead anywhere anyway) then the level runs fine.

                          NOTE: This NOTE not by author.
                          I fixxed the major HOM.  Five sidefs didn't have
                          lower texture defined.  If I shouldn't have added
                          this note...mail me at cjr8559@tamsun.tamu.edu

    Another facility needs clearing of badguys. Don't you get tired when
they keep asking you to do it. P.S. I liked the pictures.
