Misc. Author Info       : This is my 5th WAD file and the 2nd one that my wife 
			has more or less designed.

Description             : A dark haunting WAD. With much emphasis on horror
		       and the macabre. We tried to make it as gruesome
		       as we could without overdoing it. I think. I've made 
		       this WAD file a little less difficult. No hidden exit
		       this time. All the weapons are in plain sight. There's
		       also ample weapons and ammo to kill all the 
		       different monsters.

Additional Credits to   : id for DOOM & Geoff Allan, author and creator 
			of DoomED-The Real Thing.

==============================================================

To play this WAD, switch to your DOOM directory and type:
doom -file dmomen.wad, then start the game as usual, pick
episode 3, the skill setting doesn't matter, they're all the 
same. Or you can copy the batch file that I've written
into your DOOM directory. Run the batch file from your
DOOM directory by typing OMEN. It will warp you straight
there. You won't have to go thru the menu.

All comments/suggestions welcome.
