Description             : The-Keep is a revision of my Castle.wad.
                          I renamed it due to a previous wad with
                          the same name by someone else.  Due to 
                          many interesting comments, I have added 
                          more windows, more monsters and also a way 
                          out of the moat if you happen to fall in.

                          The-Keep is a castle with towers, dungeons,
                          and a moat.  It has a good deathmatch or
                          single-player layout.

                          A demo is also included in the wad file
                          that shows all the secret areas and 
                          switches.  Just sit back and watch it 
                          after you boot doom -file the-keep.wad.
