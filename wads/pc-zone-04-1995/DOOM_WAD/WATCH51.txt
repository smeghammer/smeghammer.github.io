Description             : This is my first DOOM level (but don't let
			  you put that off) This level started off as a  
			  small level but continued to grow as I got new 
			  ideas for rooms.

Additional Credits to   : The creator of DOOMED THE REAL THING 
			  (PROBABLY THE BEST DOOM EDITOR IN THE WORLD)
			  And to the creator of WADED and also thanks to 
			  Jonathan Hastings for play testing and giving 
			  me ideas for my level.
Note                    : This level contains many traps monsters on pillars
			  that come down behind you crushing ceilings etc.
			  
Coming soon             : Look out for Cybo#.wad and Myhouse#.wad

Base                    : This level is based on mine1.wad (the level that 
			  came with DOOMED) although it has alot more. the 
			  file increased from 40,846 bytes to 192,961 bytes
Editor(s) used          : DOOMED THE REAL THING and WADED
Known Bugs              : When crossing some of the sectors to screen flickers
			  for extremely minute ammount of time not really 
			  important but just generally just irritating for me 
			  as I do not know how to get rid of it
