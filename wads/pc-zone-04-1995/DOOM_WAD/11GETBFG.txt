Description             : "The United Allied Cooperative (UAC) has developed a
                           new secret weapon, the BFG9000. Your assignment is
                           to break into their headquarters and get it. We
                           will place you at the entrance. Just go in, get it 
                           and come back out (getting the BFG will lower a
                           sector at the entrance, allowing you to exit the
                           level from there). We don't know the layout of the
                           building, but we do know that there is an armoury
                           behind a red key door, and that the red key is kept
                           in the computer room which itself is behind a 
                           yellow key door. This is important as we suspect 
                           that you may encounter some resistance, and the 
                           only offensive equipment we can provide you with is 
                           a lowly pistol. Good luck."

* Construction *

Base                    : New level from scratch
Build Time              : hours, days, weeks, months (a long time)
Editor(s) used          : DEU and BSP, until they failed. There seems to be a
                          limit to the size of the level. BSP11X did not help,
                          and I've had to scale this level back. IDBSP seemed 
                          to hang every time I tried it.
Known Bugs              : One texture goes dark when you get close. Everything
                          else seems to work properly. There's a lot of stuff
                          so you'll need a fast machine (486 minimum).
