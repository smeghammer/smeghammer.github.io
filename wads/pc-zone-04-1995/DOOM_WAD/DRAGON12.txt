Description:
===========
  A massive level that originally started out looking like a dragon.
However, due to size limitations of the DEU editors (See below), I was
forced to shrink and stuff a few sections until it ended up looking
more like a mutant hunchback doberman with a severe case of hemorrhoids.
My options were to redraw to make the artwork appear better, or go with
a level that is an outright blast to play.
  Easy choice - Artwork be damned, let's kick some ass!
  I didn't care much for the "Let me see you get through THIS!" kind of
attitude that seems to have destroyed the fun in what would otherwise have
been some really good PWADs, so this level is unconditionally playable.
There are only a couple of what I would consider tough puzzles to get past,
and there are no death pits: If you can get in - you can get out.
Basically, this level is a lot of fun.  I hope you enjoy it.

===========================
Authors MAY use this level as a base to build additional
levels.  I designed it as an E1 M2 level so that it could
easily be inserted into a new episode since most of the other
available WADs have been E1 M1.

You MAY distribute this WAD, provided you include this file, with
no modifications.  You may distribute this file in any electronic
format (BBS, Diskette, CD, etc) as long as you include this file
intact.


Editor Observations:
====================
  During construction I found that if any of my vertices were placed
beyond 8000 or -8000 on either the X or Y axis that the game had a
tendency to lock up or kick out.  Moving all vertices into areas less
than 8000 seems to have solved the problems.  If you examine the
placement of three of the extreme edges of this level you will find
them in the high 7700 to 7900 range.  (Most notable being the top of
what was supposed to be the wing and the poor excuse for a tail.)
  I have seen other levels that were successfully constructed beyond
these limits but these levels have been known to freeze on occasion
for some users.  If anyone else can verify the 8000 limit as causing
problems I would be interested in hearing about it.
