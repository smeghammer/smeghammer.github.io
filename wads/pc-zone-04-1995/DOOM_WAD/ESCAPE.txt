			  Nice one Doc!

Description             : A spooky castle with skeletons in the dungeons. You
			  have been incarcerated here for a few years after
			  unsuccessfully attempting to storm the place on your
			  own (a foolish thing to do). Still, your superiors 
			  think you might have useful information (if you're 
			  still alive), so they send in a real marine to bail 
			  you out. Unfortunately, your guard is a tough nut 
			  and manages to blend the marine's brains with the 
			  wallpaper before himself buying the farm. Pity, 
			  you'll never finish that game of halma. With his 
			  dying breath the marine croaks something about a 
			  secret passage and a teleporter waiting for you out
			  in the woods, so you set off, wondering who in Hell 
			  designed this amazing place. You wish you had more 
			  time to hang around.

			  The file is ESCAPE.WAD and is a level E1M3, i.e. 
			  episode 1 mission 3. It supports 2 modes: killing 
			  mode (ultra violence only), and strolling around 
			  whistling and giving it all the architect's 
			  once-over (all other settings). It is not 
			  particularly suitable for deathmatch, I don't 
			  think, because it's fairly linear. There are no 
			  keys or any of that unrealistic stuff which is for 
			  RPG wimps <g>.

Instructions            : Put ESCAPE.WAD in your DOOM directory, type
			  "doom -file escape.wad" and start a new game, 
			  choosing a skill level (Ultra Violence = monsters 
			  and carnage, all other skill levels = love and 
			  peace, you can wear your sandals). 
			  Then type "idclev13" and off you go!

			  any other parallel or nonparallel universe in

			  or anything nuclear, molecular, cellular, cosmic, 
			  digital, analog, human, humanoid, android, 
			  synthetic or nonsynthetic, or any other life, 
			  death, or intermediate form. If anything happens, 
			  tough luck buster.

Base                    : New level from scratch

Build Time              : According to Indian mythology, there is somewhere
			  a block of material 1 million times harder than
			  diamond, measuring 1 million miles cubed. Every
			  million years a little old man comes along and
			  gives it the gentlest caress until it's all worn
			  away. I noticed yesterday that my wife and kids
			  left me last month. Oh, I never had any?
