Description             : This is a DEATHMATCH 2.0 pwad.
                          Please play this wad with the -altdeath
                          rules only (Doom 1.666). Old deathmatch
                          is no fun with this pwad - you need 
                          respawning items !

                          Ayrton is the second part of my deathmatch
                          2.0 trilogy: 1. peace_20
                                       2. ayrton_2
                                       3. coming soon !
                       
                       *  This new version of ayrton.wad has larger
                       *  rooms so you have more space to fight.
                       *  I included difficulty levels that change
                       *  the type of weapons available:
                         
                           1 and 2 : Rocket Launcher
                                 3 : Rocket Launcher + Plasma
                           4 and 5 : Rocket Launcher + Plasma + BFG
                         
                          (Shotgun, chaingun, chainsaw and Berserker at
                           every level.)
                           
                           -> I recommend to play skill level 4.
                           The BFG is not easy to use in this level -
                           the best weapon for ayrton is the plasma gun.

                          Monsters: one Trooper :)
                          !! try to keep the Trooper alive while
                          !! playing deathmatch
                          
Info                    : This is my latest Deathmatch pwad.
                          The level is very compact, so you
                          won't search to long to get a frag.
                                                    
Additional Credits to   : Ayrton Senna for being the greatest
                          racing driver ever.
                          Everyone who enjoyed my prior levels
                          peace and peace_20.
