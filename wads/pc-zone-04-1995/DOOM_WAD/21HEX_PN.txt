Description             : You look down a short corridor to a door. You
                          fire a round - the air thickens with roars,
                          hisses, and groans. What the HELL have you
                          gotten into? As you hack your way through,
                          you see shattered gardens, dimly-lit halls with
                          sleeping chambers, a well...
                          Good thing there's no pink munchers!
                          This isn't the best level possible with the base
                          I started mooching around with, but it *is* pretty
                          interesting! It's possible to get through on UV if 
                          you think about it!
Feedback                  Please! What's good, what's bad (limit yourself
                          to 6 pages or so), what extras you'd like...
                          I'm more than happy to collaborate.

                          My wife for putting up with 3 am sessions
                          My boss for believing those excuses for the
                          bleary eyed look every morning;
                          And id. Of course.
