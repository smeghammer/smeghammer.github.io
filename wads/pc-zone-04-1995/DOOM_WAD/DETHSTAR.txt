This level was made using DEU5BET4 and DEU50 (the best level editors I
have seen. I highly recommend DEU).  It replaces Episode 2, Mission 1,
as per ID's request that no new levels be made for Episode 1.  It is
completely new, not a hack of an existing level.  This is my first Doom
level, but I think it is very good.  There are some tricky parts, and if
you are ever tempted to think it is unfinishable, you can watch the demo
I have provided.  Thanks to Justin Mansell for help using the DEU editor
and to Eric Alspaugh for help with aesthetics (textures, etc.).  If
anyone sees any way this level could be improved, please feel free to
send me your ideas.
