Misc. Author Info       : This is my first two attempts to make Doom levels.
                          Hope you find it to you liking.
                          Many thanks to the whiz kids at id software 
                          for coming up with Doom!
                          Also thanks to Brendon Wyber and Raphal Quinet
                          for DEU5, a most excellent Doom editor with 
                          which these levels were created.

Description             : I have made an effort to make good playability 
                          for all difficulty levels, and also to make things
                          look good. The construction is straight forward.
                          Weapons:
                          (Chain gun, Plasma gun, Shotgun, Rocket Launcher)
