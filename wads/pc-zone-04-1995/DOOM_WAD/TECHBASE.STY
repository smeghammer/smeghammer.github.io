The Techbase Story
------------------
        It was like what, a day ago?  Sneaking along, sniffing out clues
to explain why the hell THEY are here.  So easy.....even with that damned
spider thing stomping around causing a general ruckus.  A day ago...in just
24 hours I succeeded in getting my ass hauled across a couple hundred 
lightyears, and thrown into a cosmic jail cell.  But God knows it didn't
start a day ago.....God damned bugs, no what did TacCom call 'em?  Extra-
dimensional beings?  Bugs all the same.  Hoppin' outta the walls like 
bugs...smellin' like bugs...fightin' like bugs...yeah...bugs all the same.
        When the Great Marine came through the portal back to earth he 
ran into pure hell....some called it the end of the world...remember when I
called it fun.  Anyway the War for Earth lasted for months, finally resulting
in the destruction of about two thirds the human population......damn lotta
deaths...but a LOT more on there side.  It was estimated that the bugs 
suffered mortal losses....that they would have to route and regroup if they
had a chance.  Of course TacCom estimated alot of things wrong those days..
        Nobody knew that they had spaceships.....our spaceships.  The 
Interstellar War started with the attack on NewPhobos.  It still continues
today.  A war of strike/counterstrike, each side trying to hit the other
where it hurts the most, and I guess that is where I come in.
        TacCom Special Unit 3, the 'Dogs of War', I of course, her commander.
They sent me here, TechBase 5, on rumours that a HEAVY weapons shipment
was going down.  'Collect intelligence.' they said, 'It wont be dangerous.'
they said, HA! Shows what they know!  Sl`Tek Kor came on me with my back
turned and my weapons in my holster....why the hell did I trust TacCom????
        Well, here I am now....in a cell....552 lightyears from home...
But all is not lost....I have a gun and my health.  Lord knows I've seen
my share o' challenges....heh heh...I know there is a weapons shipment.
I also know that a dropship has arrived to pick up the stuff....
Hitch a ride....cause some hell....get out....easy as pie.  Maybe shoot
some TacCom employees on my way out...heh heh...that'll be the day....
-------------------

        Ok, so here is the drift on TECHBASE.WAD.
        YES, there is a spider demon on the level.  The point is: YOU
AREN'T SUPPOSED TO KILL IT!!  Don't even try.  Sl`Tek Kor is there for
story purposes....if you don't like him then he takes a 'leave of absence'
on the easy settings.  Generally he can't even hurt you unless you stand in
front of him.....there are things to hide behind and, jeez...just play it.
        YES, there is multiplayer....as of yet I haven't tried it out.
        YES, there is deathmatch....I haven't tried it yet (my friends lack
14400's :) It should be interesting.....heh heh.....I put a rather surprising
start area in.........
        Even on God mode it is fun.....do IDDQD and IDKFA and try to knock
Imps off of ledges with rockets....hehehehehehe....try to get Sl`Tek Kor
to kill his own troops......just HAVE FUN.
