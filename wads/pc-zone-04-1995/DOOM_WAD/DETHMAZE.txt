Misc. Author Info       : A bright, perfect 14-year-old who 
                          plays FAR too many violent games :)

Description             :    Welcome to the future of combat training:
                          The Holodome. Since long before the 
                          colozination of planetary moons, Earth's 
                          finest military have been trained here. 
                          With the ability to create any environment,
                          situation, dream, or battle, the Holodome 
                          has tested every Marine currently on earth. 
                          The failure of this final test is much worse 
                          than non-admittance to the ranks of marines:
                          failure inevitably means death.
                             Today is your chance to graduate from simple   
                          grunt forces to acceptance as a full marine. 
                          Your Test: Journey through the dethmaze in 
                          search of the Blue keycard, which grants you 
                          the only door from the Holodome... 
                            But beware! With luck, you will only be up against
                          computer-generated aliens, souls, ect. But if Lady 
                          Luck has thrown you to the wolves, you'll find your
                          selflocked in a maze with only one other,a thinking, 
                          fighting grunt like yourself, aimed on destroying
                          anyone or anything in his path to becoming a
                          marine! Your only hope of surviving this is the
                          destruction of your counterpart! You stand at the
                          edge of the pit to the Holodome with a shotgun 
                          found in your current room. with a box of shells. 
                          Now only YOU control your fate, my friend!
