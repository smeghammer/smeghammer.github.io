Misc. Author Info       : This is my FIRST WAD file so PLEASE give me your
                          comments so my next upload will be even better!

Description             : The Mars base, the center for all advanced 
                          scientific research of the UAC has stopped all 
                          communications with the PHOBOS base. You've done                           
                          what an entire well trained millitary unit couldn't 
                          do 2 times over AND gone through hell, and now the 
                          millitary thinks your tough enough for there 
                          biggest problem yet. Can you win back the base? Or 
                          have it's occupants gottne too big a foothold
                          This may become a level in a Shores of Hell 
                          replacer I may do, so yor comments are IMPORTANT!!!

Additional Credits to   : ID and Geof Allen, and also David Bruni. Without 
                          his tutorial I would still be pondering how to make 
                          Doors!
