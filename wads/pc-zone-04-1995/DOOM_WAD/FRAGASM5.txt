Description		: A five-level fast-paced DEATHMATCH 2.0 frag fest.

These are the first five levels of the FRAGASM ALTDEATHMATCH episode.

E1M1: The Corridors of Death. Multilevel hallways, multiply interconnected,
interwoven with lifts. Do you dare to drop down to pick up that box of
rockets...???

E1M2: The Elevators from Hell. Ever have one of those dreams where you
were stuck in an elevator and couldn't get out? Well, that dream just
came true... only this time there are 3 Space Marines gunning for you!

E1M3: The Arena. This might have been the level used for the 9/10/94 VGC
DEATHMATCH tournament, except id told VGC it couldn't use PWADs. ;-)

E1M4: FRAGASM. Have a fragasm!

E1M5: OCTAFRAG. Lots of multilevel interconnecting claustrophobic
passageways with 4 more Elevators from Hell in the middle. Give your
opponents the shaft!

(NOTE: E1M4 of this PWAD was previously released separately.)

Additional Credits to	: The CES Marines for mucho playtesting.
