			  time and you still have not found on you
			  just love.  Now you have.  This doom wad
			  has several aspects to it and for many it 
			  be a quick level and for others it can be 
			  hell, seriously.  This wad took four engineers
			  about six straight weeks to complete working 
			  almost non-stop 12 hours a day to bring this to 
			  you.  The scenery is new and scary as there 
			  are dramatic canyons and never before seen 
			  monsters.  Also in this level there is graphics
			  that only a top notch engineer could create.  Go
			  ahead and take this wad and your life will change.
			  From here on out you will be happy and doomed...

I Ray Fladeboe grant anyone the right to enjoy this wad for 
any period of time.  However I would like this registered
for a one time fee of $70.  Make this payable to Ray and mail
it to me before adding to this wad or selling it for profits.
I am a nice man and if you have a problem call my office at
714-830-7000 and ask for Ray.  This level took such an 
extensive period to create that I am forced to charge for it.
All members that worked on this wad are air traffic controllers
and risked their jobs by doing no work till this wad was complete.
Bottom line is basically just send me money or just enjoy the wad
and if you want more just call me for the next version in progress.
This wad could have never come about if Stormy had not done the 
dramatic graphics involved in this masterpiece so thank him as well...

The End......
