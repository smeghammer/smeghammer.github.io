Description             : Deathmatch fun.  Lots of multiple entrances to
                          most areas.  Great for doubling back on your 
                          opponent.                                

Misc Game Info          : This is the second release of my PWAD.
                          I fixed some misaligned textures and fixed
                          one Hall of Mirrors bug I found.

Additional Credits to   : Robert Kemmetmueller for his input and suggestions.
