Hello,

This is my second wad attempt. Its a little more involved than the first one.
The fun part to this level is to try and figure out what the shape of the map 
represents without looking at it. This level really consists of four mini- 
levels which are exited by means of a one way teleporter. If you enjoyed it
let me know. By the way, I am not sure how to place the deathmatch start points
since I have never played a modem game before. I live in the 315 area code and 
am very interested in playing a modem game with someone. If you would like to 
set one up please feel free to E-mail me.
