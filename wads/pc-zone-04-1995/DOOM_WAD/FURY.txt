Misc. Author Info       : Thanx to Joe, Marc, and John for testing my levels, 
                          good and bad.:)
                          Thanx to Dr. Sleep for advice and inspiration. :)

Description             : "We're on an express elevator to hell, goin' 
                           down!" You have lost contact with the mining colony
                           codenamed FURY. It is your job to find out what has
                           happened to the colonists. Sound familiar? 
                           probably. This WAD is still fun to play though.
