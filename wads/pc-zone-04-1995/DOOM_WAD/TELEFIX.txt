TELEFIX.DEH - A patch file for DOOM utilizing Dehacked and Dmaud to get
rid of all traces of the teleporter sound and flash. *RECOMMENDED FOR DM*
First and foremost: 
This patch is intended to be compatable with deathmatch play.

Teleportation sound has been killed. Period. Monsters, exploding corpses,
telefrags, players, et. al. don't make a sound going through it.

Teleportation is also completely invisible and nearly instantaneous.
(this is great for creating invisible, unnoticeable teleports in
stairways and such to simulate levels)

*THIS IS HOW DEATHMATCH SHOULD BE - NO IDEA WHEN THEY ARE COMING FOR YOU!*
