Level   :  Episode 1 Level 1
Command :  doom -file fez1.wad
Par Time:  at least 30 minutes

This is a brand new complete Doom level created using DEU 5.0 with a little help 
from bsp 1.0.....both great tools and almost as much fun as playing Doom itself.
This level has become a little too large - just recompiling it takes nearly 10 
minutes.....so I decided to finish it off and release it....

This is my first wad, hope you enjoy it - please feel free to e-mail me with
comments or bug reports regarding this level which I hope will be the first of
many.......this has taken probably well over 24 hours over more than a week so
I may take a break for a few days......

Enjoy......

Grahame.............
