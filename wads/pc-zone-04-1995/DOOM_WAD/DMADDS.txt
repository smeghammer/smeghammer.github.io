DooM ADD Sprites - Version 1.0beta
----------------------------------

Description
-----------

DMADDS is a tool to allow for sprite graphic replacement
and replacement distribution by means of PWAD files. 
Up to now, this is possible only if *all* sprites are 
included in one WAD file, wether IWAD or PWAD.


Contents
--------

You should find 5 files in the archive:

dmadds.exe::    created with DJGPP 2.5.7, COFF2EXE,
				GO32 already merged in

dmadds32.exe::  same, will run only with GO32.EXE 
				installed properly

empty_s.wad::   an empty sprites replacement PWAD
ghosts.wad::    a simple demo replacement PWAD
dmadds.txt::    this short readme file



How to create a PWAD sprite distribution file
---------------------------------------------

Step 1: Make a copy of empty_s.wad. Do not change the
		original file, you'll need it again if
		you want to create other sprite PWAD files.

			"> copy empty_s.wad  my_graph.wad"

		You may load "graphics.wad" with 

			">doom -file  my_graph.wad",

		but unless you are able to play DOOM with
		eyes close, this won't make much sense....

Step 2: add all the sprites you want to distribute
		using the excellent dmgraph1.1.

			">dmgraph (graphic) -s (file) -f my_graph.wad"

		Now all your sprites are included in "my_graph.wad",
		and if you load it with ">doom -file my_graph.wad",
		you'll be able to check if everythings works out.
		Of course, all the sprites you haven't replaced are
		still missing.

Step 3: distribute your "my_graph.wad". If you want to,
		include this package with it to ensure that 
		others are able to use the PWAD.


How to use a PWAD sprite distribution file
------------------------------------------

Step A: Make sure that "dmadds.exe", the "doom.wad" and
		the "my_graph.wad" are in the same directory.
		Note that "dmadds.exe" will only work with the
		"doom.wad" of the registered DOOM 1.2. Make sure
		that there are at least 2.5 MB disk space left.

Stpe B: Use "dmadds.exe" to combine "my_graph.wad" with
		the sprites from "doom.wad"

			">dmadds my_graph.wad complete.wad"

		This will take merely a minute or two on a
		486DX/66 with VLB hard disk controller, but
		it may be a lot slower on other machines.

Step C: After dmadds has finished, the should be a
		"complete.wad" PWAD file with approx 2.2 MB
		or less, depending on the replacements. Use it
		with

			">doom -file complete.wad"



How to use the example
----------------------

The file "ghosts.wad" is a very simple replacements
sprite distribution PWAD file. If you want to be sure
this works out, use it as described  above (Step A,B,C) 
as the "my_graph" file.

I don't know if it's fun, but you'll get an impression 
how much of a level you remember, and it makes "deaf" 
guards a lot more dangerous. Increases the amount of 
ammo needed as well...


Remarks
-------

Note that "dmadds.exe" WILL NOT CHANGE "DOOM.WAD"!

The obvious disadvantage is to file size of the completed 
PWAD. If the speed of "dmadds" is sufficient, delete the
complete PWAD files, if you don't need them, and
re-create them from the distribution PWAD again, so
the 2.2 MB are only used if actually needed.

In addition, if you are already using a GO32.EXE, you
may use the much smaller "dmadds32.exe" instead of
"dmadds.exe", in which the 70KB "go32.exe" is already
merged in.

			

No Warranty
-----------

Imagine the usual disclaimer. "dmadds" is a quick'n'dirty
port of a UNIX tool, and I had to do a lot of changes to
get rid of some overhead. It will work only with PWAD files 
which include ONLY sprites, created from "empty_s.wad"
as described above. If you want to add sounds or
other resources, you should put them in another PWAD.
