Description             : This WAD is designed for single-player
                          and to be similar in atmosphere and difficulty
                          to the supplied levels.  Multi-player and
                          Deathmatch starts are included however.#
                          Named after the remakable resemblance
                          between Spectres and Pete Sampras which
                          I only just noticed. (Don't ya just lurve
                          Wimbledon?)

                          miscellaneous improving ideas)
