Description             : "Nice room(s)... lotsa space"
                           Seriously, this is my first attempt
                           at creating a level with enough room
                           and variety to allow for both interesting
                           multi- and single- player action.


Additional Credits to   : id (best game in town!) and my sister
                          Jewell McCraw who helped with the playtesting
                          (over a 14.4 modem) and various exclamations
                          at my new additions while playing.
