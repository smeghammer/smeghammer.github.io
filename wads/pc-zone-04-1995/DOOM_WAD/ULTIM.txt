*DOOM: THE ULTIMATE DEATHMATCH LEVEL*

Title:  ULTIM.WAD
Author: Emil Eisenhardt
Compuserve address: 72610,2100
Description:  I created this level with the intention of it being
an extremely fun Deathmatch level.  There are many sniper towers,
teleports, weapons, and places to explore.  I have play tested
this with some friends and found it to be great.  I hope you
think the same!  Includes the chainsaw lover's best dream! 
Simple, short, but great fun.  Very different.  If you are
looking for an intricate, mind boggling level, this is NOT one of
them (but you can try it anyway).  On the other hand, if you like
to have LOADS of FUN, please try this out!  

  *Play Info*
ULTIM.WAD works with:

Episode 1, Level 1
Single Player
Cooperative
Deathmatch (most fun)
Difficulty settings:  I know that some people think that the
BFG9000 is unfair in Deathmatch mode, so I have made it VIRTUALLY
impossible to obtain in "Ultra- Violence."  If you DO like the
BFG9000, play on an easier level.  There are very small changes
between the first few difficulty settings.  
   
  *Construction*
I built this level from scratch using the DEU editor 5.0 (and
later, 5.1) and BSP Node Fixer-Upper (both which I obtained from
Compuserve).  It took me a few weeks to construct (balancing
schoolwork and sports), and the only "bugs" I know of are a few
minor texture offset problems.  Otherwise, it should work fine.

PLEASE: If you are going to edit this level or distribute it,

(too many to count) trying to make this level as fun as I
possibly could.
