Description             : This is primarily a Deathmatch level, but it's kind
                          of fun as a single player also.  Not much to say,
                          got the idea from some other levels I saw, and the
                          look from some of the Doom ][ pictures I've seen.
                          Hope you like it.  This is my fourth released pwad.
                          COMING SOON:  WOODY.WAD!!!

NOTE                    : Unlike my previous Deathmatch level this one is a 
                          little more straightforward.  It has monsters, 
                          a good amount, and relies more on an interesting 
                          design than lots of nasty tricks.  I don't play DM
                          with monsters, but I realize that some of you do, so
                          they're there if you want 'em.

HELLO?                  : If you like this level, let me know.  If you hate
                          it, let me know why.
