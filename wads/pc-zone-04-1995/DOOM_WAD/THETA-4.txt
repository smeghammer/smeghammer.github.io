Description: 

Due to the imposing evil forces that presently inhabit the Earth, the United
Federation of Space Marines (UFSM) have set up an isolated training ground 
hidden away in mountains of Tibet. What was once a peaceful shrine dedicated
to meditation of Tibetan monks, THETA-4 (Territorial Human-to-Human Earth 
Training Area) has been converted into a highly active centre for the 
training of Marine recruits. 

The THETA series training grounds specializes in battles that are strictly 
marine vs. marine, since it has been shown in the past that there have been
a number of cases where platoons have been completely wiped out by one of 
their own "former" marines, due to possession. Like all the other THETA's,
marines will fight each other, not other monsters (there are none).

Your goal is simple - eliminate all other opponents. You have every weapon 
at your disposal, yet to get to each one may not be easy. You also have the
choice to play with the shrine containing only weapons (ie only those items
which will not disappear) or with the place littered with every kind of item 
and weapon imaginable. To exit the level you must cooperate.

PLEASE NOTE:
============

         - For those of you who have an older version of THETA-4, you may
           notice a few changes:
                - The single player scenario has been removed.
                - Skill four is now designed for a -respawn deathmatch game.
                - Deathmatch starts have been more evenly distributed.
                - There are now TWO ways to exit the sniper's nest.
                - fixed a texture (whopee.)

           I removed the single player scenario because I plan on including
           this with a DM episode which I'll be releasing in a few months, 
           and I figured that those who download DM wads never usually play
           the wads solo anyway.

         - Here's a breakdown of what's included for each skill level:

     Skill    Comments
     =============================================================
     1        No items that disappear, only weapons
     2        Same as above, only less ammo when you pick up
     3        Weapons and LOTS of items
     4        Some monsters (for respawn game), weapons, no items
     5        Same as above (NIGHTMARE!)

        - For multiplayer games, the exit button is between two RED
          torches. 2 players must cooperate in order to get to the exit.

        - This level was designed to be a Deathmatch level - there are no
          toxic areas where the opponent can kill himself. The only way you
          can suicide is by rocketing yourself.
          
        - The level is riddled with ambushes and snipers spots. For example,
          the stairs leading from the doors at the beginning have a little 
          nook near them. The trick is to open the door, and hide in the nook.
          The opponent will notice (or hear) the door opening, then proceed
          in that direction, up the stairs, right past you. This will give
          you a perfect shot in the back.
        
        - It is possible to get ALL the weapons without cheating. Check the
          demo if you're stuck.
