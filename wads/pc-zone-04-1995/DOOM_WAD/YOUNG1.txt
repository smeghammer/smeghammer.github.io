Description             : This is my first WAD and I think it captures the
                          spirit of the original DOOM levels - with a few
                          new tricks of my own!  Hardened DOOMers shouldn't
                          have many problems getting off the level - 
                          but my challenge to you is to collect all of 
                          the weapons - they're all available, from the
                          chainsaw to the BFG - but they're not all easy
                          to collect...

* Other Notes *

This WAD contains a fairly large map.  Thanks to the facilities offered
by DoomEd the textures all fit together reasonably neatly - and I've managed
to avoid the 'telport-pads-divided-into-four' problem which I've seen in
a lot of other WADs.

There are a *lot* of secret areas - though I hope that none of them are
too difficult to find.  The clues are there for you to spot!  A bit of a
hint to make life easier for you:  you can find a few useful items before
leaving the first area!

I haven't tested this level for its Multiplayer capabilities but there
are a few good vantage points and usually more than one way to get from
point A to point B so things should be fine.  I've also added in extra 
MediPaks for multiplayer games to make things last a little longer in the
event of Deathmatch battles.

I hope you all enjoy this level, comments/queries etc. are welcome to
