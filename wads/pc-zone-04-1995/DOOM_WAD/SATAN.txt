Misc. Author Info       : This is my first attempt at making a wad file.
                          Hope it's entertaining!

Description             : You're trapped in Satan's home turf.  He watches
                          you as you struggle to find a way out and he laughs
                          at all your attempts to escape.  At every turn, his
                          band of ghoulish fiends try to make your stay as
                          unwelcome as possible.  And finally, if you live to
                          reach the end, you will confront Satan himself along
                          with all his minions worshipping him at his altar.
                          Can you overcome the onslaught of evil, the over-
                          whelming numbers of hellish demons and monsters, and
                          Mr. Evil himself: Satan?  Come, find out for 
                          yourself.  Step into Satan's Lair. |-(

                          Well having that said, I made this wad file for
                          blood and guts shoot 'em ups.  You'll find all the
                          weapons and ammo you need plus a lot of other
                          goodies to fight all those hellspawn critters.
                          Because this file is a little on the hefty side,
                          you can't save any part of the wad file.  But it's
                          a do-able level if you pace yourself and take note
                          of where all the goodies are.  So kick some
                          hellspawn ass and enjoy! :-)
