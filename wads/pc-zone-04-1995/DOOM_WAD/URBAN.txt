Description             : (You might remember this level as 
                          DETHE1M1.  I've finally decided on a
                          theme for my episode, so I added some 
                          graphics and here it is.  I changed 
                          alot of stuff, and made the level a 
                          little more interactive.  If you liked
                          DETHE1M1, then you'll love Urban Wars.)

                          The year is 2099 and V-Town has suffered
                          from major incidents of gang related 
                          violence.  All of America's resource 
                          could not free V-Town from the gangs, 
                          so the city is in chaos.  In an effort 
                          to save yourself and your family, you 
                          decide to fight for leadership of the 
                          gangs.  You will battle many gang 
                          members, and eventually your friends 
                          (deathmatch partners) to become the 
                          leader of V-Town.  You are now 
                          enlisted into the URBAN WARS!

                          (This is just the beta story, but is 
                          really close to the real thing.)

                          The war starts in your family's home
                          just after you declare your leadership
                          challenge.
