* The big setup *

I looks like an ordinary football game, but it isn't.  You aren't watching
it on TV at home. You look around and realize that it is you standing in the 
field.  It's you against the very worst from hell.  
   You are the defense (What did you expect, to be on the offense!? Ha! Get 
real!). Their front line is the biggest one ever assembled.  Fast and wryly 
wide receivers are ready for the aerial assault.  One look at the quarterback 
and you know he will be throwing everything at you.  You look over to your 
bench and see what happened to the rest of your team.  You look at their 
bench and see they still have plenty of reserves to pound the living krap out 
of you.  Fortunately, they let you start the game, giving you time to gather 
your defense for their all out assault.  Are you up for it?
