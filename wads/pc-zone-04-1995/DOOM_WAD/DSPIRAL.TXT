Description             : A different kind of deathmatch level, based upon
                          an idea conjured up by myself and Justin Powell
                          (author of Death Match Prison). You only get to
                          select on weapon per life, as does your opponent.
                          The playing field is dairly simple: The better
                          bonuses are harder to get, and there are some nice
                          hiding spots, and a place to suicide if your
                          situation seems hopeless. There are also a few
                          pesky monsters to liven it up, and some more
                          than pesky monsters guarding the bonuses (hint:
                          take a chainsaw one of your times out) Oh, BTW:
                          in case you didn't figure it out yet, this level
                          is for Death Match only <g>.

* Construction *
============================================================================

Base                    : New level from scratch
Build Time              : About 6 hours, give or take a day.
Editor(s) used          : DEU 5.0 and BSP 1.1x
Known Bugs              : There are some areas where the ID engine hits
                          its limit in terms of how many transparent
                          sidedefs can be calculated in a row. This
                          may cause some tiny spots of bleeding (or
                          "Hall of Mirrors"), but does not indicate
                          unassigned sidedefs or a major problem.
                          Simply move a little in a direction and it
                          will probably stop.
