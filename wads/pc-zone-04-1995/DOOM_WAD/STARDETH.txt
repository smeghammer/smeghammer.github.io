STARDEATH "A star is dead" v1.0 
a PWAD by Derek Morton (73054,612 or mortman@delphi.com)
==========================================================================

A huge Deathmatch play level with a few nasties added to spice things up
a little bit. Vigorously tested for two man deathmatch play but should
support four man play. Average two man deathmatch game lasts between
20-30 minutes when playing to ten frags.

HINTS:
------

Starting Star lift: Starting about halfway between candelabra and Star 
                    lift, walk towards Star lift.

Stopping Star lift: ??? Try experimenting by walking around the star's
                    perimeter. Walking over certain sides of the pillars
                    will also work.

Monster Pit:    Raise the pit with the 'eye' switch. Monsters cannot cross
                the blue 'monster barrier' but they can slip out the back.
                NOTE: Let the Baron live and watch him catch your 
                opponent(s) when they least expect it.

Automatic Door: Once the door closes it stays that way for 30 seconds.

Teleporter lift:    Lift to teleporter is activated by exiting the gray 
                    hallway with the red ceiling. Be quick about it!

Enjoy....

p.s.

Feel free to send your suggestions and/or comments but you can keep the
criticisms to yourself. I'd appreciate receiving a saved four player 
deathmatch game. This PWAD would seem to be ideal for that.
