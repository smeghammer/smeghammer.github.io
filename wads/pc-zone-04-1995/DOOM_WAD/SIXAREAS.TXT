Misc. Author Info       : Spends too much time hacking and chopping
                          doom.

Description             : A wad based on six separate areas that
                          lead from a central room. The
                          entrance to each area is marked by a
                          number on the door. The level can be
                          best solved by following the doors in
                          order. In addition, there are 34 new
                          graphic elements (most in the status
                          bar). See if you can find them all.

                          creation of the editors I used. DEU,
