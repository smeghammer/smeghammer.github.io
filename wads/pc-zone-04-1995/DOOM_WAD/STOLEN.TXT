Description             : This is a nice deathmatch level.
                          It is relatively small.
                          There are 8 transporters.
                          The switch to end the level is hidden.
                          There are only 3 extra weapons.
                          There will be many frags.
                          No STARTAN3.
                          Lots of tricks and hiding places.
                          Texture alignment.
