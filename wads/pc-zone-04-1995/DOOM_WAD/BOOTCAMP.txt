Skill 1: Target Range
LOTS of exploding barrels, ammo and weapons for your pleasure!

Skill 3: Deathmatch Arena
A bare-bones fighting area to fight your opponent with your pistol
or just plain "Duke It Out"! Plenty of cover.

Skill 4: Death Dominos
TONS of exploding barrels. Just aim at one, shoot it, and haul ass!

This PWAD was designed for basic combat training in DOOM. It covers
all the essentials. Marksmanship, hand to hand combat and agility.
PLUS blowing up the barrels is a BLAST! There is NO exit.
Push any of the walls for a fresh supply of barrels, ammo and weapons
(You advance to the next level but the map is the same as the previous
level [E1M1-8, E2M1-9]).

Copy all of the files into your DOOM directory.

To run, type:
"DOOM -DEVPARM -FILE BOOTCAMP.WAD -NOMONSTERS"
Leave out the "-NOMONSTERS" switch if you want to try monster killin'.
Select "New Game", "Episode" and "Skill level" (See above chart).

Some helpful cheats (Type while playing DOOM (They don't work in MP mode!)):
IDCLEVxy : warp to episode "x", level "y".
IDKFA    : all weapons, health and armor.
IDDQD    : god mode.

For MP play be sure to add "-DEVPARM", "-FILE BOOTCAMP.WAD"
and "-SKILL (1, 3, or 4)" (See above chart).
Add "-WARP x y" if you want to battle DOOM boogers (Without "-NOMONSTERS")
(See above chart for "x y")).
Add "-WARP 1 9" if you want to battle ALL the DOOM boogers (This is the only
way to access E1M9 in MP mode!).

Included are several small demos: type "BC-DEMO" for a short movie.

                   Have a "BLAST"!
