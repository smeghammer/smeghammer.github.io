This is version of the E1L1 level. It's really over 2 weeks old, but I didn't
have the intrest of making it final until now. This DEATHMATCH scenario and
it won't be as good if your playing alone, it's boring when your playing alone.
There are several teleporters and other special things to make it deadlier.
Anyway here it is, ENJOY!

Tested for 48h... Final valuation: GREAT!
