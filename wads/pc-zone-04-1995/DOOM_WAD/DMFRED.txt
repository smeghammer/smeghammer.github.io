How to run DMFRED
=================

Copy DMFRED.WAD into your DOOM directory, and type:

doom -file dmfred.wad <return>

Then select Episode 1, "Knee-Deep in the dead"

Alternatively, to go straight to this level, type:

doom -devparm -file dmfred.wad -warp 1 1 <return>

Notes
=====

This is my first real attempt at a DOOM level - I've stuck to fairly
simple things like lifts and doors, but there are a few puzzles to
solve, and several secret doors.

Any comments, hints or suggestions are very welcome.
