Description             : "An enemy spaceship has approached our planet and is
                           now in a low orbit. We beamed a squad of soldiers 
                           aboard in the hopes that they could somehow subtly
                           sabotage and destroy it, but we've lost contact 
                           with them. In their last transmission, they 
                           indicated that they were trying to get to the helm
                           on the bridge and slow the ship enough that it 
                           drops out of orbit and burns up in the atmosphere. 
                           The ship now has its deflectors up and beaming 
                           aboard is no longer an option, however, the ship's 
                           deflectors do not interfere with it's own beaming 
                           device, nor with non-light-energy based weapons. So
                           now, the only way we can break into the ship is 
                           with brute force.

                          "Your assignment is to take a one man spaceship up 
                           into space, attach yourself to the side of the
                           enemy vessel, break into it and somehow destroy it.
                           Getting out is optional (the helm will lower a 
                           sector in your little spaceship, allowing you to 
                           leave the level). Take along whatever equipment you 
                           need. We suspect that the squad is being held in 
                           the brig and that they may be able to provide some 
                           assistance. Good luck."
