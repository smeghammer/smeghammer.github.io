Misc. Author Info       : Finished my exams !!! :)
                        Also I made the K9 wad which got a 
                        rating of 3.5

Description             : The troops the UCA sent into the 
                        Tibetan base failed to get past the 
                        helipad. Therefore it's up to you to 
                        crawl in through the caverns upon which 
                        the base was built. Within the caverns 
                        is a deserted monestary where the 
                        scientists, working at the base, have 
                        been testing with radioactives. Your 
                        job is to find out what happened in the 
                        base and TAKE IT BACK !!!!

DEATHMATCH SPOILER : DEATHMATCH SPOILER : DEATHMATCH SPOILER  




















IN DEATHMATCH:-

There is a room in the wad which has some teleports to top of 
lifts. These lifts come down when someone walks over a 
'pressure pad'. The teleport sends you to a hidden location near 
to where they are so that you can blow them away :)
