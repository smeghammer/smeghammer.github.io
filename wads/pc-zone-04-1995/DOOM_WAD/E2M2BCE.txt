	A great completely new level by Brendy Ebel. The unfinished version
was called "E1M7BCE1.WAD". Now here is the full version. This level is fun for
multi or single player and for registered DOOMers only. To run, copy the file
to your doom directory and run doom with "-file E2M2BCE.WAD" added to the end
of the command line. Once in doom warp to episode 2 mission 2 using the
"IDCLEV" code.
