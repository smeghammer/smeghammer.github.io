Description             : (This is the first mission of my death 
                          match episode.)  Remember playing war 
                          with your friends when you were 
                          little?  This level simulates the fun 
                          of the good 'ol days with a mix of 
                          good 'ol violence.  I made this level 
                          to match my old home  in Washington 
                          and I added a few secrets, ambush 
                          spots, a cooperative exit, and only 
                          ONE suicide spot!  Great for  
                          no-holds-barred matches!  (Type 
                          "death" to start in deathmatch mode.)

Additional Credits to   : Jean, the author of Forest, because I 
                          used his great sky graphics.  (It 
                          matched the Wash landscape.)
