                          replacement episodes for Wolfenstein 3D

                          DOOM GOLD II, & DOOM GOLD II BRIGHT as

Description             : Sound and (some) graphics replacement
                          PWAD for commercial DOOM.

Notes                   : Previous versions changed sound music and
                          lighting.  This version leaves the lights
                          and music alone and changes only the sound.
                          This makes for a smaller PWAD.
                          For those users interested in loading new
                          music and/or lighting along with DOOM GOLD
                          sounds, get DGOLD2.ZIP or DGOLD2BT.ZIP
