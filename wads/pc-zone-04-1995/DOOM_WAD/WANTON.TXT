	WANTON.WAD is a damn big new level for E1M1 registered
DOOM which I think fulfills all the above definitions.... Ok, so it
may not be that lewd or lustful but the imps do wear spikes which does 
kinda remind me of bondage r sumthing.

	Wanton can be played solo, cooperative or deathmatch and the
difficulty levels are active. I definitely suggest playing hurt me
plenty or easier at first and working your way up if you feel brave.
This is a very large level (average play time is 40 mins to SUCKS) and
it will challenge your dooming abilities. In order to complete this
level you will need to be quite effective with ALL the E1 weapons
including a good right uppercut.

	This is not a "puzzle" level though there are many secrets to
be found, and it's also not a "ooh ooh I got an editor I think I'll
make you fight 3 Cyberdemons and a Spiderdemon or two but it will be
ok cause I'll give you a BFG and 10,000 enegypacks in the first room
and it will be fun yeah" level either. Most importantly, the default
deu wall texture isn't used anywhere (I reallly hate that texture.)

	Wanton was created using DEU 5.0 and BSP1.1x both of which are
bitchin' programs. Kudos to the authors.

	Ok, enough ramblin'. Enjoy! 

Lemme know what you think of this level, comments and flames welcome.
