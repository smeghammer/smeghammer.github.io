NOTEs on the level:
1. Try it first without any of the codes...you'll enjoy it more.
2. All of the monsters appear on all levels, so changing the skill
   levels won't help you there.
3. Most objects are there for a reason, i.e. location of secrets.
4. Level is compatible with deathmatch and co-op modes.
5. Look closely at the faces on the ship...

Please give me feedback on anything you deem necessary. Thanks.
Have fun!
