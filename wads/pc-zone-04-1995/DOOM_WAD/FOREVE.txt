WHO WANTS TO LIVE FOREVER MUSIC FILE FOR DOOM
Who Wants to Live Forever by Queen.
Foreve.wad created with M Music Editor version 1.0

I created this wad by playing Who Wants to Live Forever on a Yamaha PSR400 Midi keyboard and saving as a midi file.

I then used MIDI2MUS to convert the midi file to *.MUS format.

TO RUN:

From the DOOM directory, type:  Doom -file foreve.wad.

This is my first attempt to do something with my computer besides simple games.  Let me know how you enjoy it or if you encounter any problems.
