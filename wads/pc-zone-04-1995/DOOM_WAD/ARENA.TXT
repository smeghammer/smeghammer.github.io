Misc. Author Info       : This is my first attempt at wad
			  creation and I wanted playability
			  over looks, so although all the
			  textures align etc, don't expect
			  anything flashy in this department.

Description             : Deathmatch heaven.  Basically it's a 
			  large central arena with various sub
			  areas scattered arround the edge for
			  good measure.  There are a few monsters
			  in there to provide a source of ammo 
			  and to create some traps *grin*.  I
			  The level _designed_ to be played with
			  respawn, it will be lame without it.
