Description
-----------

    So you killed everything in sight, got a medal and think you're cool
now.  Well to bad, soldier, because Space Marines never retire!  The captian
said something about an old industrial area being taken over by Satan, but
you were rebuilding your BFG at the time so you didn't catch it all.  All you
know is that once that teleport is activated by the dinky little private
standing across the room, you're in for some for a monster of a drycleaning
bill.  As you walk across the teleport departure room to grab your trusty
Bag O' Guns (TM), you trip over a energy pack and your weapons go flying
thorugh the air.  Lacking the experience of a battle-hardened killer, the
private at the controls decided this would be an opportune time to activate
the teleport system.  As a result, your atoms are beaming though space at
near-light speed -- your weapons are doing the same, only in different
directions.
    As you begin to materialize, the first thing you see is not good.  A wall
of evil, spine-ripping hell-beasts are ready to prove that they aren't called
that for nothing.  Hoping that all of your guns landed _somewhere_ in the
complex, you grab your pistol from it permanent position in its holster and
pray there's an easier way out of here than using a mere 50 bullets on what
appears to be a quite formidable opposition.

    (I wrote this text while on #doom, so don't complain if it sounds
     a little strange :)

Additional Credits to   : JonnyBag (Jon Kerr) - Helped with planning
                          Reepicheep (Paul Medynski) - He was just sort of
                                around for a lot of the time :)  He's still
                                finishing the sequel...
