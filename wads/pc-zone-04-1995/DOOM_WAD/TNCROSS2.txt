TNCROSS2 - A DEATHMATCH LEVEL (E2M1) BY VALIS

Well, perhaps it's time to update this.  No elaborate maps of New
Jersey, no amateurish clipping errors to put up with...  just a clean
and slightly diabolical level for the dedicated Deathmatch player!  A
few secret passages provide opportunities for healthy backstabbing and
rabbit punching, just the way you like it.  :-)   Other secrets and
physical feats abound.  A few monsters thrown in to keep everyone
honest...

Yes, it was done with DEU 5.0 and cleaned up afterwards with BSP 1.0.
We can safely certify that Windows was not run at any time in the
preparation of this level.  :-)

This will probably be the last release of TNCROSS, so we hope you enjoy
it.  Next, a general exploration level.     }-Valis-{
