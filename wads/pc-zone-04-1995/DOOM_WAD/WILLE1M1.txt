Description             : This is my first level!  I intend to
                          create a "realistic" set of levels
                          where the player SLOWLY builds up a
                          good arsonal (is in ID's original
                          levels).  This first level is
                          relatively short.

Additional Credits to   : My roommates & friends for play-testing.
