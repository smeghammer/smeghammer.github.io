Misc. Author Info       : My first attempt at a level.Never sat in front of a 
                          computer until 5 months ago, so I'm still learning. 
                          My wife has threatened to blow up the thing if I 
                          dont quit "DOOMING" so much. Oh well, I'll just buy 
                          another......
Description             : No story to this WAD. I put the emphasis on traps 
                          and hidden rooms. You need to beware when 
                          backtracking, but its necessary to go back through 
                          some rooms. You must have the red key to exit
                          but it will not be easy to get. If you are quick 
                          and can hide, you can get it. Please let me know if 
                          too easy.

Additional Credits to   : All the people at id for their fantastic game, R. 
                          Quinet for DEU, my son Chris for testing, and my 
                          wife Vicki for not killing or divorcing me.
