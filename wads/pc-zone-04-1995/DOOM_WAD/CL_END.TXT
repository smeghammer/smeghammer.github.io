Nuts! Somehow you cooked 'em all and
shut the place down! You check the
tower to see if there's a way to
contact Connors.

But nothing works! No satellite link,
no radio, not even a damn homing
pigeon--just shotgun-blasted consoles
and smoking wires. In disgust, you
start kicking everything in sight...

Suddenly there's a *SNAP* in the air,
the lights go out, and you hear the
low rumble of thunder that you slowly
realize isn't thunder at all.

Uh-Oh...
