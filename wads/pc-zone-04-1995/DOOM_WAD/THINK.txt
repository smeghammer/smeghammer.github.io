think.zip -- two brand-new doom levels, think11.wad replacing E1M1, and
think12.wad replacing E1M2, developed using DEU5.0 and recompiled with BSP1.0.

To play both levels, type "doom -file think11.wad think12.wad"
To play think11, type "doom -file think11.wad"
To play think12 without going through E1M1, type
	"doom -file think12.wad -devparm -wart 1 2"

These should be quite easy to complete even with 100 % kills for experienced
Doomers. They should also be accessible to less experienced Doom players...
If you make use of your mind, you can even make them trivial...

They are also intended as doom-tricks 'libraries' for doom level makers,
showing a few tricks that could be integrated to bigger Wads.
