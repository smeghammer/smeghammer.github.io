Description             : This level is a downsized version of an extremely
                          large level I created which would not save due to
                          "savegame buffer overrun." This level has been 
                          tested on 3 different systems and exhibits no such
                          problem.

                          Pay attention to wall textures and check your map
                          once in a while.  Remember the one really bad monster
                          is EXTREMELY easy to kill, once you know how. There's
                          no need to cheat, 'cause I hate him too. Note the
                          multiple bezerk boxes are simply a way of me giving the
                          player 100% health without using multiple medikits.
                          Too many useable things is the key reason some levels
                          wouldn't save (although the number of sectors also 
                          seems to have a negative effect).  Thus my reason for 
                          cutting down on the number of medikits by using single 
                          bezerk kits.
