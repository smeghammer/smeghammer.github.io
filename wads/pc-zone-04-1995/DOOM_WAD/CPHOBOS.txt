THE STORY:

Your wandering around the martian moon landscape when you stumble 
across an odd structure built into the side of a mountain.  A closer
look reveals the entrance of a castle with two watch towers.  

"What in Hell is this?"  you ask yourself.  It would appear as if 
some architect had too much time on his hands.  Anyway, it seemed
quiet now, maybe too quiet.  BETTER CHECK IT OUT!

General Rules I followed: If it looks liquid, it is dangerous
                          All rooms are setup logically
                          All items are placed logically, not scattered
                          Each level exit is a smooth transition to the
                            next level.  (the maps can be pieced together)
                          Secret doors only give credit to actual secret
                            rooms.  Otherwise it may just be another route.
                          Some secret doors can be spotted with a good
                            eye, some are next to impossible.

================================================================
LEVEL 1:  Castle Entry

        The main entrance to this castle seems to lead inside a
        mountain.  What could lay inside the mountain?

Date Completed          : May 10, 1994

* Notes *

I had a good time creating this one.  The idea behind it is to challenge
the player by forcing a method of regulating ammo for proper use.

Only two secret doors are necessary to find for completion.
If you have trouble getting into the castle gates, then watch the demo.

If your playing on a 386, you may experience a huge slow down in a few
rooms containing large amounts of detail.  For best results, don't
load an EMM driver.

This is the first time I have ever seen this type of level ending
just watch the scenery as you hit the exit.  You can view the
transition between levels.  (Yes you can connect the maps too!)

=====================================================================
LEVEL 2:  Storage 

       Looks like someone built a wharehouse inside the mountain probably
       trying to keep it hiddin.  Perhaps something truly odd is happening
       within this castle?

Date Completed          : May 18, 1994


* Notes *

I was not too happy with the results of this level, but it isn't bad.
Someday, I may edit this one or replace this level entirely.

It is easy to exit without completing much, but who wants to anyway.
I tried to improve on using crates and putting a twist on the storyline.

There is only one puzzle wich turned out to be easy once you learn 
the buttons.

===================================================================
LEVEL 3:  ARENA!

       Back to that mideivel crap again!
       On the other side of the mountain lies an arena built within a
       canyon.  This could be someones twisted idea of entertainment.


Date Completed          : May 27, 1994

* Notes *

This one is my favorite level and it is a big one!  Many Secrets!
Many Monsters!  The size of this level will cause slower PCs to 
produce a slower than normal game, but it will speed up half way
through the level.

You should have trouble finding 100% secrets even if you cheat! 

However, cheating should not be necesary since this level is not that hard  
if you found the necessary weopons on the earlier levels.  There's plenty
of ammo and health here because the main idea is to have fun kicking butt
and finding those secrets!  Enjoy!

* Serial link/Modem users:  You better be playing with an updated 
   sersetup.exe and not with the one that came with version 1.2
   Otherwise you will experience slow down and possible lock ups.
   The best results are with 19200 baud communications and both 
   PCs being 486.  If you need a new sersetup try downloading
   DSFER27.ZIP.  You should try higher baud rates to see if they work.
   Also, do not load an EMM driver.

========================================================================
LEVEL 4:   Cathedral

        This level looks dark and creepy!  Better becareful!
        Where are these monsters coming from?

Date Completed  : June 7, 1994
* Notes *

I must give credit to my freind, Sean,  for the starting position of 
   players 2 and 3.  (You really should experience this one in 
   multiplayer, if you don't have a network near you, then find one!)
   If you can't play on a network and want to know where players 2 and 3
   start:  Just look behind you when you start, you'll figure it out ;)

I hope you found your weapons, 'cause you are not going to find any here!

There is a room  that you can not enter in a one player game.  Don't 
   worry though, there is nothing in there during a single player game, 
   but you better get in there if your playing multiplayer!  

This is the smoothest transition between levels, you can even veiw the
final room in level 3, just turn around when you start.
