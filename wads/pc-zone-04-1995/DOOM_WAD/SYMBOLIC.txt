Symbolic.wad Info
-----------------
I tried to make this wad playable for everyone, easy to hard levels
(not impossible), no places to get indefinately trapped, all textures
match up, theres one place where there are switches but aren't shown as
switches, this is intentional (they're in an obvious location though).This
is my first creation so I don't know what to write other than I believe 
it's worth the download. I'm very critical about myself, so it's probably
better than I think, and I think it's good!
