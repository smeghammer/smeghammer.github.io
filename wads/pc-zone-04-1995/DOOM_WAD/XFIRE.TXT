Title                   : XFIRE.WAD   
Author                  : Marcus Westrup
Email Address           : mawestru@okcins.okanagan.bc.ca (until Sept.)
Misc. Author Info       : Just another student in a DOOMed world.

Description             : A weird mix of half-baked ideas. (YOU try to
                          come up with something original to compete
                          with all those other new .WADs).

                             Level one is just being cute, and gives
                          you a chance to build up supplies.
                             Level two is short, and is based on a
                          simple idea. Better oil that chain saw! (Hint:
                          experiment a little with the pistol...)
                             Level three is big. The "crossfire" room
                          (you'll know it when you see it) is a blast.
                          For a treat, try walking through it backwards!

                          

Additional Credits to   : Someone who lent me a 486dx to do all this
                          work on.

* Construction *

Base                    : From scratch.
Build Time              : Too damn long.  I want my life back.
Editor(s) used          : Deu51, Deu52, BSP11x, BSP12x, and a sharp pencil.
Known Bugs              : The larger and more complex rooms may show some
                          HOM in the distance; I expect this to improve with
                          the release of DOOM 1.4
                          (Because this was done on a 486, I can't say
                           how well it will play on a slower machine; some 
                           rooms may run slow).


* Copyright / Permissions *

Authors MAY use this level as a base to build additional levels. In fact,
you can do anything you like with it. I didn't develop DOOM, so why 
should I restrict what happens to these WADs.  Enjoy!

I also welcome anyone who wants to replace any of the sounds/music.
All I ask is you put a new version number on it before re-release.

For that matter, these levels could also use a good REJECT resource table.
Has anyone come up with a Reject builder that works?
