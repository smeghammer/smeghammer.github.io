Description             : Slagfest!  This wad is very challenging in single
                                player mode and even harder in coop mode.
                                The deathmatches are fairly good since the
                                level is small but two player games still
                                have problems with finding each other.
                                I can't think of anything else to write
                                so play it yourself and see what you think.
