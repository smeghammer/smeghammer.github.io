Description             :       Unlike LURKER this is nothing but all out     
                          action from the get go.  If you like rolling over
                          your frag count, look no further.  This was 
                          designed with -altdeath in mind, but should be as
                          fun to play regular.  Our first night with the 
                          final version of this lasted 5 hrs.  (Hint - when
                          you roll the frag count the second time go ahead 
                          and sneak a peek at your watch).
                                Here's the deal, eight circular rooms joined
                          by halls that intersect in a central hub.
                          Four of them are higher than the other four.  There
                          is a platform in the center that allows players to
                          run across without dropping to the lower level, if 
                          they are running top speed.  The platform drops if
                          you tap the side from one of the lower halls.  On
                          the upper level, however, if as you are sprinting 
                          across you tap the space-bar(or whatever opens 
                          doors for you) the platform will also drop. This
                          means that whoever is chasing you will suddenly
                          be on the lower level.
                                One other interesting feature: in the center 
                          (on the platform) is an arrow it points toward the
                          room with the rocket launcher.  Whenever someone 
                          goes for it, this arrow will turn black and there
                          will be a black arrow on the ceiling, alerting the 
                          other players.
                                There is a co-op exit in the eastern crushing
                          hall.  The switch that opens the exit door is 
                          behind the rocket launcher in the westen end of the
                          level.
                                There is no plasma rifle or BFG in this WAD.
                          There is only health (in the form of beserkers) in
                          "I,m too young to die" other-wise what you start 
                          with, is it.
