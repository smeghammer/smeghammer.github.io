Description             : Lots of level ideas I had incorporated into a
                          Deathmatch level.  It differs from most Deathmatch
                          levels that I've seen in that it has multiple
                          weapon locations (somewhat preventing a player from
                          hanging out near one), a few traps that allow for 
                          alternate killing methods, and a means to
                          permanently cut off the route to the BFG if it 
                          becomes too annoying (be careful of what switch
                          you hit).  It also has a few really good hiding
                          places (if you can find them) and lots and lots of
                          ammo.  IT IS NOT PLAYABLE AS A SINGLE PLAYER LEVEL!
                          It has a coop exit and no monsters, but there
                          is a player one start point so you can look at it.
                          This is my second level.

Base                    : New level from scratch
Construction time       : 20 hours
Editor(s) used          : DEU 5.2
Known Bugs              : Slight HOM in large open acid room if standing in 
                          just the right place.  (I had to painfully simplify
                          this room just to get it down to this, and I didn't
                          even notice it until after several, several hours
                          of playtesting.)  Anyway, its the distant doorway, 
                          and it slightly reflects the walls on either side
                          of it, no actual texture mirrors, though.  I maybe
                          could have fixed it, but didn't really feel inclined
                          to, already working on a new level.
