Misc. Author Info   : I am a student at uga.  I have 
		      been playing doom for about 3
		      months and figured I'd try
		      to author a little wad. 

Description           I included a sad little demo 
		      to warm things up.  This wad, 
		      I hope, is decent for dm, coop 
		      or alone.  

Additional Credits   : Travis Stracker, Reed Cartwright
