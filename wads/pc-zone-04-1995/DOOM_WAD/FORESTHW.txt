========================== additional note =============================

    When I wrote the following text, DEU 5.21 was not available yet.
Keep in mind that you may be able to do all of what I describe by
using only DEU 5.21 with the X, I, R and G command. All you need it
to put the modified GIF file in DOOM.WAD with DMGRAPH, extract it to
a raw file with DEU's X command, put the original graphic back in
DOOM.WAD, load your map in DEU, the include the modified graphic with
the I command, then read the graphic in the PWAD with the R command
and lastly, group the two PWADs with the G command. You may include
as many PWADS as you want (DEMOS too), but DEU has a limit of 12 open
files at a time. You'll have to group the PWADs in seperate DEU sessions
if you have more than 12.

Hi,
    I'm the author of FOREST.WAD (get FORESTxx.ZIP on many sites), and
am also a beta tester of DEU. When I released FOREST 1.1, I was the
first (to my knowledge) to release a PWAD that included new graphics
and new demos. I thought it would be nice for other DOOMers to be able
to do what I did, so I will try to explain how I did it in a simple
language. I will include BATCH files and DIR files so that you can
use them as examples to do it.

**********
Before I begin, this is VERY IMPORTANT, WAD MASTER PUTS AN IWAD MARKER
AT THE BEGINNING OF THE PWAD FILE, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, BEFORE 
UPLOADING ANY NEW WADS CREATED USING IT, CHANGE THE "I" TO A "P" BEFORE
WITH ANY HEX EDITOR. This is probably because it was written before 
ID released information (or someone else) about the IWAD-PWAD formats.
**********


You will need these files:

WT100.ZIP (Wad tools 1.0) to view the graphics in the DOOM.WAD file
              and find the name of the texture you want to change.

DMGRAP10.ZIP (Doom graph 1.0) to extract and store a GIF file to/from
              the DOOM.WAD file.

DMAUD11.ZIP (Doom audio 1.1) to extract and store audio files to/from
              the DOOM.WAD file (I didn't do it, but you could also
              include new sounds in a PWAD file)

WDMSTR05.ZIP (Wad Master 1.0) to extract the raw data from your new
              levels and the modified textures or sound from the 
              DOOM.WAD file.


How does it all come together?
   Once you have created your level with DEU (or any other editor)
decide what texture you want to change, find out what it's name is in
the DOOM.WAD file with WT and extract it with DMGRAPH. For example if
you want to change the SP_DUDE2 texture, you will find with WT that
it's name is WALL50_2, so use the command "DMGRAPH WALL50_2 -e file.gif".
You will want to check the insertion point for when you put the modified
graph back in with "DMGRAPH WALL50_2 -v". Once you have the GIF, do what
you want (I used PhotoFinish to edit it), store it back in DOOM.WAD
with the command "DMGRAPH WALL50_2 -s newfile.gif -i 63,123" (make a
copy of it first to be able to put back the original in) so that you can
extract the RAW file with WAD Master. 

    To use WadMaster, you need to create a reference DIR file with
WADDIR. If your new map is called "NEWMAP", and we want the
dir file to be NEWMAP.DIR then type:
"WADDIR NEWMAP.WAD >MEWMAP.DIR". Once you have the DIR file, you must
edit it so that seperate entries (levels, if you have more than one
level) do not go in the same directory. Look at the first few lines
(without the comment), they will be like this:
E1M1\                    E1M1\                   0
THINGS                   THINGS                  10
LINEDEFS                 LINEDEFS                952

you must add a dospath to the first column like this:
E1M1\                    E1M1\                   0
E1M1\THINGS              THINGS                  10
E1M1\LINEDEFS            LINEDEFS                952

(make sure the column 2 starts at the same place)

Once you've done that, you can extract the raw data to dos files
in a directory, so create a directory (like NEWMAP) and type the command
"UPKWAD -o NEWMAP NEWMAP.DIR NEWMAP.WAD" and this will extract all
the resources in the PWAD map you created to the directory NEWMAP.

OK! now let's put the modified GIF in there! Look at the order in which
the DOOM.WAD directory is (do WADDIR >DOOM.DIR) so that you can put the
new graphic in the proper order (it won't work otherwise). You will want 
to copy the NEWMAP.DIR file to an other name, let's say NEWMAP1.DIR and
edit it to add the proper references to it. WALL50_2 is in the P2 section,
so you need to add the folowing lines at the end of the NEWMAP1.DIR file:

P2_START\                P2_START\               0
P2_START\WALL50_2        WALL50_2                17544
P2_END\                  P2_END\                 0

(notice that the DEMO1-3 are just before the E1M1 entry, so you could
put the lines as they apear in DOOM.DIR just before the E1M1 line in
NEWMAP1.DIR and copy any demo lmp for your PWAD to NEWMAP\DEMOx (no LMP
extention). That's how I did it)

Once you've done that, create a WAD DIR file to be able to extract the
raw graphic from DOOM.WAD (after storing the modified GIF, let's call
it NEW50_2.GIF in DOOM.WAD with "DMGRAPH WALL50_2 -s NEW50_2.GIF"). You
will also need to create an other directory, let's say GRAPHIC. So, 
create the WAD DIR file like this: (let's call it GRAPHIC.DIR)

P2_START\                P2_START\               0
P2_START\WALL50_2        WALL50_2                17544
P2_END\                  P2_END\                 0

and type the command "UPKWAD -o GRAPHIC.DIR" (it used DOOM.WAD by default)
and you will have a new file in GRAPHIC\P2_START call WALL50_2. I 
copied the raw files to an other name, but you don't have to. You can
just copy it like this "COPY GRAPHIC\P2_START\WALL50_2 NEWMAP\P2_START"

Now we're ready to put the new graphic and demos in a PWAD file. So
type the command "PKWAD -o NEWMAP NEWMAP1.DIR TOTAL.WAD". Remember that
you have to use a modified wad dir file (that's why I typre NEWMAP1.DIR
instead of just NEWMAP.DIR) that includes the new files you want 
included in the new PWAD file, like the DEMOs, graphic or sound
resources. You can put anything there!

To finish it off, here's a copy of a series of files I used to create
FOREST.WAD, I will not explain them here because you should be able
to figure it out, if not, there is documentation that comes with
Wad master, I figured it out, I'm sure you can.
