Description             : My first WAD.  Designed for single player mode
                          with some nice surprises in it.  Up until you get 
                          the red key it has a strange resemblance to where
                          I work. In fact that Baron seems to be in my 
                          bosses office ;)

Additional Credits to   : Andrew Gerrard and Jon Dyer for creative input.
                          Hugh Gibson and Adrian for beta testing.
