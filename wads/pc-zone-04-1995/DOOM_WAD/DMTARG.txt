HELLO! 

This is my first wad attempt so excuse its simplicity. Maybe it isn't simple
to everybody but when you design a level and you know where everything is
it becomes quite easy.

I'd like to thank the usual people-- id software and the designers of deu and
bsp, but I would mostly like to thank Rich Dersheimer for his wonderful deu 
tutorial. It is available on AOL.

Please feel free to E-mail me with your criticism. If I receive positive 
encouragement I will continue to make more complicated levels. If not I will
just crawl into a secret room and eat the end of my BFG9000! Just kidding :)

If you want to write to me I am:
