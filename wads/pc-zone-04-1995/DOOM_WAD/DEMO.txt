Hi Fellow Doomers.

Here's a level I wipped up from the original e1m2.
To use it run use.bat. To view the demo of it run demo.bat

I think it's just about perfect for deathmatch or a coop slaughter :).
No longer need you run around the whole level in search for you buddies
now there are 9 teleports to get you places in a flash.
Of course you can also do some nice destruction along the way blowing
to bits 80+ sarges, 50+ imps and 40+ troopers. Watch out for that barron
or two ;)

Yeah, I know this level sucks processor big time, so I recommend 
*at least* 486DX33 with 8Mb. VLB would help too. If it's still slow
or too hard then play on lower difficulty. It still bloody 8).

I made this on a 4Mb machine so my demo came out choppy :(... and I didn't 
go the way I usually go 'cause I wouldn't wanna spoil your game by showing 
ya all the secrets etc. Can you find that prized Plasma Gun? (muhahahaha).

I actually tried to place key items in strategic places. Also difficulty
has a bearing on the game. On the lowest level you might find e.g. shotgun or
chaingun in front of your nose. On the harder levels, well, you gonna hefta
look for it. Oh, and did I mention a ton of new switches, platforms, nuke
pools etc. Most of the wall decorations have been replaced apart form the 
computer section which was kinda hard to improve on. You'll also find
more stuff and enemies in multi-player mode, just as expected.
And most iportantly the level is rather dark (no cheating with F11
hear me!) which makes it rather fun for deathmatch mode. 
If you find the play is too slow in deathmatch then try using -nomonsters 
parameter. 

Now, go and have a bloodbath.

oh, and if u think I stuffed up somewhere send me a note.
