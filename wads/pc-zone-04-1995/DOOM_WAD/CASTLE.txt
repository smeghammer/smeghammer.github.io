Imagine that you walk up to a castle. It's big, and very dark.
You look up. Somebody is shooting at you from the turrets!
Better start moving, or you'll never escape. You run around
the outside. The castle is surrounded by a moat, and there's
no back door. Just a small window high up on one wall. Darn,
you'll have to go in the front door.

I built this level from scratch using BEU5.0 and BSP11X. It is
the biggest, most complex level that I've ever seen. Well over
a thousand vertices and linedefs. Lot's of tricky bits, pretty
scenery, and violence. I would appreciate seeing an LMP for
a triple 100% on ultraviolent.

This level replaces episode 1, map 1. It allows multi-player and
deathmatch games. It's tuned for single player.
