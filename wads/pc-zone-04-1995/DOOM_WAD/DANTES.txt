Description             : This is my first level, folks, so be gentle with
			  me.  For the most part, the only "theme" I had in
			  mind was to make the level as aesthetically pleasing
			  and consistent as possible.  In other words, I wanted
			  it to look neat.  There are lots of little nooks and
			  crannies scattered about, and (I hope) a few sur-
			  prises.  I really hadn't intended the level to be so
			  big (128K) when I first started; but, you know, one
			  thing led to another and I just didn't know when to 
			  stop.

			  Please let me know what you think by E-Mail on CIS.
			  Enjoy.

Instructions		: Put DANTES.WAD and DANTES.BAT in your DOOM directory,
			  then run the batch file.  Hit New Game, Knee Deep, 
			  and choose whatever skill you wish. (For a kinder,
			  gentler introduction that takes you right to it, run
			  the KIND.BAT.  This skips the intro stuff, chooses 
			  "Hey, Not Too Rough" skill, and jumps right into the
			  level.  Modify the batch file -skill # as you please.)

Disclaimer		: I assume no responsibility for anything of any sort
			  in any way, shape, or form, now, then, henceforeward, 
			  in this life (or the next several) for any screw-ups
			  or even minor inconveniences this PWAD causes you,
			  your family, your relatives, friends, ancestors,
			  associates, employers, pets, neighbors, lovers,
			  deities (major AND minor), nor any other person --
			  living, dead, or undead -- that you have or will ever
			  have any contact with in even the slightest form.
			  This PWAD has been tested and tested ad infinitum, so
			  it shouldn't mess with your computer or anything else
			  remotely associated with it.  But if it DOES, then
			  too damn bad.  Don't come cryin' to me.  It must be
			  something YOU did.

Grammar Lecture		: "a lot" is two words, not one; it's "you're," not
			  "your" -- as in "you are" unless you're (see?) using
			  the possessive in your (uh huh) text descriptions;
			  "their" indicates possession, "there" indicates
			  place or direction.**

			**I don't mean to sound fussy, guys -- but geez. 
			  You're supposed to be the brain-trust for the future.
			  I mean, I see these wonderful PWADs and DOOM Editors
			  for Windows and stuff with HELP files that read as
			  though they were written by some guy who could 
			  barely scratch his name in the dirt with a stick.
			  Not that I want to cast any aspersions, but you can't
			  mean what you say unless you can say what you mean,
			  don't you know.
