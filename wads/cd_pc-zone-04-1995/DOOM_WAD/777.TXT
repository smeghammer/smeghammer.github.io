777.wad

This is the 'sequel' to 666.wad.  It is actually smaller in extent than 666
but more complex.  You cannot get stuck anywhere, contrary to what it may
first seem.  (Though if you fall in the pits in the 1st room, you're dead --
but this is the only place where that's the case).  If it seems to end rather
abruptly that is because I ran up against DEU's limit for memory (not to
mention that it started to get slow).  On that same note -- it was developed on
a 486DX-33 with 8MB and the 1st room or two are pretty slow on UV -- but it
does speed up.  You may want low detail,  maybe not.  I have tried it on a
60MHz Pentium with 20MB RAM and man was that nice.  Kinda makes me want to
spend some $...  Ah well.

There are deathmatch and cooperative starting spots.  I haven't tried out
either significantly (tried deathmatch for a few minutes).  If anyone finds
any problems, let me know.  There are features in the level designed for
deathmatch.

Oh, on UV it is pretty hard.  Some say too hard, but I assure you it is
possible.  I added some extra ammo to help out, but it is still tough.  You
may want to try it 1st on Hurt Me, though experienced players may find that
too easy.  Ammo is (was) very precious on UV.  If you think it is too easy
then remove some of the ammo and try it like I had originally intended --
bust out that chainsaw and kill what you can to save ammo (you might have to
anyway -- hehe).

Well, that's more than enough rambing.  Have fun.  Please mail any comments,
criticism, etc to stimson@leland.stanford.edu.
