Beginning with this version, several WAD files are being included. 
Don't edit these with any Other<tm> editors, since platform descriptions 
will be lost.

These are to be considered works in progress, or proving levels. I know
that some things aren't perfect. All of these WAD files are for E1M1.

Steps1.Wad      - Totally custom level. Have fun!

Steps2.Wad      - same level, with a new teleporter added.

Steps3.Wad      - Tons of stuff added, still a work in progress.
                  Lots of fun for Deathmatch.
                  
Mine1.Wad       - Here is a REAL level. Lots of tricks, some traps,
                  it has NO monsters or things, Add your Own!
                  Large open "arena" is ideal for 1 on 3 battles.
                  (still a work in progress, but enjoy!)

To play, put the file in your Doom directory, and type

    DOOM -File Mine1.wad  [ENTER]
