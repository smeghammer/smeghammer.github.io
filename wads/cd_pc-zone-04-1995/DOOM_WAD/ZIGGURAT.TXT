 Features: (Contains spoilers)

        This is not an extremely large level in terms of raw size. This
        is mainly because large levels run slowly on lots of machines.
        This level (IMHO) is quality instead of quantity. I tried to pack
        as much as I could into an average size level, while paying close
        attention to detail. The level includes: (spoiler alert) A cool
        pyramid, a circular tunnel, well - as circular as you can get
        with lots of little right-angles, and a large stone face that spits 
        green fireballs.
