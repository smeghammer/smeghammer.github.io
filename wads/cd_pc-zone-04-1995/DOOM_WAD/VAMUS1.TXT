Description             : Music from Various Artists. I got these from
                          midi files I have downloaded from all over the
                          internet.
                          These midifiles are excellent reproductions of
                          the actual recorded versions of the songs.

                          Songs From:
                               Nirvana, The Who, Seal, U2, Queen and others

                          The D_INTER and D_INTRO were taken (and slightly 
                          edited :) from the XWing midi files
                          used in the swmusfx#.wad. I used these because it
                          is what I would have used in the D_INTER and
                          D_INTRO sections if I made the swmusfx#.wad series
                          and it seemed to fit into my frame of mind at the
                          time I decided to do this.

                          NOTE TO Star Wars fans and Chris Hopkins:
                             There is a new Star Wars song in this file that
                          I converted from an Amiga SMUS file. It is a very
                          well made recreation of the Empire Strikes Back
                          finale song (Though it is only 4 channels it sounds
                          great). You may want to use it in a future version
                          of the swmusfx wad file. The song is on E2M4.

Additional Notes        : This not really done but I really wanted to release
                          it. I also ran out of songs that I felt belong in
                          this wad file. If anybody has any other songs they
                          think belong in this wad file let me know.
                          Oh This sounds great on my GUS, I have never tried
                          it on an other card so I can't tell you if it will
                          sound OK on fm synth cards.

Additional Credits to   : All the composers of the tunes.
