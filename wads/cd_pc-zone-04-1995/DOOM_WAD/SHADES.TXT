Ok so you are playing the part of the roughest toughest space marine that
ever lived.  He doesn't think twice about entering a moon base infested
with the legions of hell armed only with a pistol.  A guy like that must be
so cool he could drink boiling water and pass ice cubes.  But wait something
is missing.  A guy that cool would never be seen without his shades - 
regardless of light conditions.  You can fix this major oversight by copying
SHADES.WAD and SHADES.BAT into your doom directory and start doom by typing
SHADES [return].

Doom will not be permenantly altered.

Stay cool

Enjay.
