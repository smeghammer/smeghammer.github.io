STJOHNS.WAD
===========

This is a (fairly) topologically accurate map of St John's College,Cambridge.
Architecturally speaking its fairly reasonable too (at least I think so).
Contains no altered bitmaps,textures, sprites or sounds.
Extensively play tested, designed primarily for deathmatch but single player
is ok. A co-operative ending is required (2 players in co-operation) for a
net game.

Secret passages are (mostly) relevant to St John's College and to the author,
a graduate of St Johns . A working knowledge of St John's will help you find
your way around.

INFO

not E2M8.
Difficulty levels allowed for.
Editors  - doomcad,deu,dmapedit.

Writing time - about 3 weeks, on and off.

BUGS
====
When compiled under IDBSP10, there is a Hall of mirrors effect visible at the
top of the "chapel tower" when viewed from the "main gate".This bug disappears
when compiled under BSP.However the IDBSP version is a fair sight faster
(due to having the reject resource) so is more suited to a net game.Both
versions are included.

DISTRIBUTION
============
STJOHNS.WAD - IDBSP compiled, recommended for net.
STJNOHOM.WAD - BSP compiled, slower, no reject, no HOM.
