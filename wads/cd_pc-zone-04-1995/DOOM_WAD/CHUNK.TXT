A patch for Dehacked v1.3
        
        This patch will turn your everyday rocket into a sargeant chunk and
your everyday rocket explosion into a trooper chunk.  (If you don't know what
a chunk is, try firing a rocket directly at a trooper and you will see what
I mean).  The chunk doesn't do concussion damage, but the damage has been  
increased to compensate.  This patch is perfect for you morbid doomers and 
those who like very strange doom games.  The chunks will stay there; so you 
could see where large rocket battles took place.  If you REALLY want to see
a lot of gore, try getting a patch that will increase the rate of fire of the
rocket launcher.  You'll paint the walls with bodies.
