Misc. Author Info       : Doom! rocks my world!  I can be reached at
                          the above address, but place my name in the
                          subject...

Description             : This level was originally designed as a death
                          match level.  For 2 players the deathmatches
                          tend to be more stealthy with lots of hunting.
                          With four players, it is a wild romp of death, 
                          destruction, and well, BLOODLUST!!!! >^]__ _ _|
                          It is relatively difficult.  If you try to get
                          100% kills, you WILL need to conserve ammo. I've
                          seen it beaten with one shell and zero shells
                          left!!!  This is my first from scratch level
                          (ooh!! a disclaimer!!)
