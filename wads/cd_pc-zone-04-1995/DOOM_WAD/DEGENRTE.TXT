DOOM: Degeneration I
By: Brian J. "Blazkowicz" Rowan
PLAY THIS LEVEL by typing DOOM -FILE DEGENRTE.WAD

This level was created from scratch with DEU 5.0. It is possible to play
it in 1-player, multiplayer cooperative, or Deathmatch modes. This level
took a long time to make, and a lot of debugging to fix stuff like texture
offsets.

I built this level with looks in mind rather than the challenge factor.
Still, it's moderately hard to get through on Ultra-violence. As far as
Nightmare goes, I haven't beat it yet on that mode. If anyone manages to
beat this, send me a LMP demo file of your victory. (My CIS address is at
the end of this file).

This level is Episode 2, Mission 6. If you have the program MOVELEV (by
Steve Simpson) you can change this, but if you don't and you want to get
there in a hurry, start the game on any episode and type IDCLEV26. You'll
lose your ammo and any cheat modes you've got working, so don't bother
activating all that stuff beforehand. Oh, yeah, please try playing this
level without using any codes! Not only will using codes spoil all the
surprises, but it might also ruin the look of the level (especially if you
turn the lights on!)

Finally, this is called "Degeneration I" because it is mission 1 of a
series which I'll be appending to over the next few months. It takes a
while to make a level this big, but now that I've got some experience,
things should move along a little faster. Feel free to E-mail me any
comments or questions (or especially any errors and a way to fix them!).
Thanks.
