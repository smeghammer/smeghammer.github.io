Included in this file are 2 wad files for use with Doom 1.2 by id Software.
The first one (Dark.wad) is already online. This new one contains a few
minor changes, most notably the inclusion of the BFG9000 to make
fighting the CyberDemon a little bit easier. There is also an Ultra
violence level, although its even harder than the original
 
To play this level, load doom as follows:
    Doom -file Dark.wad <enter>
    Then select New Game - 2nd Episode - Mission 1

The second one is called Sequel.wad for want of a better name. This one
has more traps and surprises and also has anothe CyberDemon towards the
end. As you might have guessed I like a challenge and the Cyber Demon is
the hardest villian in Doom:) this one seems to be easier than my first
level although not too easy. 

To Play this level load doom as such:
     Doom -file Sequel.wad <enter>
     Then select Inferno episode - Mission 1
This level is meant to be played on one difficuly level as any of the
others do not matter much.

Note: There are a couple of rooms in this level that may roon slower on
some computers because of the layout. 

These are my first 2 attempts at making levels from scratch using BSP/DEU.
Hope you enjoy them.
