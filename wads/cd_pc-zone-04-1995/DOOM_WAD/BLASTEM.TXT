Blast'em!

How cool. This is clearly my first WAD (ignoring the stains on the wall).
You'll find that while it may be a good play, it's not the professional 
piece of work one prefers in a WAD. So? Kiss my butt! I'm tired of this
level and I'm ready to move on. Well! I'll do a better job on the next one,
promise.

A couple notes: I stole the terminator II music from Phil Wheeler's 
PTULTRA.WAD. If you haven't seen it, check it out. Excellent design and a
good Cyber-battle. The few other sounds I stole from various other WADS.
Sorry, can't remember exactly which ones. Oh well, you know who you are.

Why Blast'em? Stupid question. WHY NOT?! 

UltraViolence is a tough battle. It was slightly tougher before I decided
to nix the two CyberDemons. The other levels of difficulty are easier 
('cept NIGHTMARE -- EEEEE!), but then, why bother? Same for you losers out 
there that use cheat codes. WHY do you even bother PLAYING?

Oh ya, one last thing. This level came about cause of all the useless WADs
I saw out there that had no theme or purpose. You know the ones. You stumble 
from room to room shooting anything that moves, oblivious of the horrid 
decor or your reason for continuing. Bloody waste of time if you ask me.
(Yeah I know, who asked? Shaddup!)

I'd like to ask for money but I'm afraid there's too many other people I'd

then please donate 5 bucks to your local Cancer Society. Those poor
bastards can use the help.
