Tired of the same old Doom music?  I put together some midi's that I think
really fit in well with Episode 2.  Most of them have an eerie, haunting
quality that I feel enhance the game play.

Also, my favorite is E2M9, the monster's scream at the beginning fits in
quite nicely with the song.

I fixed some bugs in E2NEWMUS.ZIP (which I need to get removed from ocf
as it also appears to be corrupt).

The new file is     e2music1.zip   on ocf.unt.edu /pub/incoming
                                   (check /pub/doom/music if it isn't there)
          and wuarchive.wustle.edu /pub/MSDOS_UPLOADS/games/doomstuff

It sounds actually pretty good on my SBPro, but really rocks on my GUS
(and probably any other wavetable card).
