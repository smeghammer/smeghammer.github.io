WADPAK1.WAD by Gary Karnik (g.karnik@att.com)

This is my attempt to take some of the best shareware PWADs for DOOM
available and combine them together into reasonable new episodes. Each
episode should be playable by a single player or deathmatch as in ID's
own levels.

This is the source for this new wad pak:

EPISODE1:              EPISODE2:               EPISODE3:
