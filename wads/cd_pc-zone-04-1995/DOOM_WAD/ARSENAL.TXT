ARSENAL.DEH patch for DEHACKED 1.3
Requires DEHACKED 1.3 and registered DOOM 1.2

Thanks to Greg Lewis for DEHACKED and Id for DOOM!

Remember to backup your DOOM.EXE before applying the patch!

Here is version 2.0 of my ARSENAL patch - new weapons and sounds!

This version includes a small PWAD file ARSENAL.WAD that has a 
few replacement sounds - make sure you load this or the grenades won't 
sound right.

Included is a quick and dirty batch file that applies the patch and runs
Doom with the PWAD. It works for me, use at your own risk!

This patch modifies the graphics, sound and behavior of the weapons:

Chainsaw -> unchanged (not much you can do with this sorry)
Pistol   - Sub UZI (unchanged)
Shotgun  - Automatic Assult Shotgun (unchanged)
Chaingun - 2x Speed Chaingun like Arnold uses (unchanged)
Rocket   - Hand grenades! (whole new strategy!)
Plasma   - BFG750 Energy Cannon (improved explosion)
BFG9000  - BFR-27 What does BFR stand for?

Note: The BFG750 blast can hurt you, and if a mis-thrown grenade lands near
you, don't hang around!

Remember, picking up the rocket launcher will give you the ability
to throw grenades (ammo = rockets). Picking up the BFG will actually give 
you the rocket launcher (ammo = cells).

Side effects: 
    The Cyberdemon now throws grenades!
    Grenades don't fall to the floor, they just 'hang' there. Sorry!

Tell me what you think!
Thanks to those who gave suggestions about ARSENAL version 1.0!
