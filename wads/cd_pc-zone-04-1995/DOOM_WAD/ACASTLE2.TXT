Description             : A_CASTLE.WAD was messed up.  Sorry.
                          This one should be OK, if not, send me
                          e-mail and I'll repost.

                          This is my first serious attempt.  Its
                          a castle complete with a two keeps, a
                          moat, and towers of different height
                          (different from rest of castle...you'll
                          see what I mean).

                          It's mostly an exercise (in building a
                          castle with different heights) so its
                          not really completed yet (as far as 
                          populating it with bad guys), but 
                          still playable...in fact, add your own
                          bad guys and go ballistic!

                          NOTE:  Send me e-mail and tell me what
                          you think...
