                          action game DOOM.  This level is

Known Bugs              : One strange one I can't get rid of...
                          In the elevator room before the blue
                          doors, the player's perspective seems
                          to sink as though stepping off of a stair.
                          However, the entire room has the same floor
                          height.  You appear to 'sink' into the floor!
                          Anybody know what causes this?  Other than
                          that, no known bugs.

* Hints for this wad:

To run this new level, copy the WAD file to your DOOM directory and type:

  DOOM -FILE APOCLPSE.WAD -SKILL x -EPISODE 1

  Where x is the skill level you wish to play (1-5).

Just watch the demo if you get stuck.  Keep in mind, the demo is played
at medium difficulty level and I skipped a few things to keep it short 
If you really get stuck, leave me a message.

To watch the demo, type DOOM -FILE APOCLPSE.WAD, and wait for it to begin.

Any comments or feedback would be greatly appreciated.  They inspire me
to start new WADs.

Check out my first DOOM custom level: LOSTLEVL.WAD (DMLOST.ZIP, DMLOST2.ZIP)
and my second: GLADIATR.WAD (DMGLAD.ZIP).  You can get these ones in the
Compuserve Gamers Forum.  Enjoy!
