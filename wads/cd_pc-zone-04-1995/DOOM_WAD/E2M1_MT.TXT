Description             : A level for guys who want mainly to fight.

    You are now at Deimos moonbase in front of an area that was
planned as an storage area by the UAC, but not used yet. You
found one dying space marine in front of the two large doors
that could tell you only that the demons that invaded this
area have two leaders hating each other and that there is a
column with four switches that controls access to several areas.

Some notes:

 o    You can't block your way if you use every switch you will
      find - but beware - the enemy could also use the opportunity.
      There is one exception I know, but to become trapped you
      have to move immediately after turning the switch. If you are
      a tough fighter you can turn all switches without much
      thinking - this level is designed for fighters!

 o    Some rooms are rather empty, because the game may slow down
      if there is too much decoration.

 o    Mail me your comments or your LMP files for this level.

Known Bugs              : Saving games is not possible, sorry:
                          it results in a 'Savegame buffer overrun',
                          perhaps there are too much monsters lurking
                          around.
                          
                          If you use some doors or lifts you will
                          perhaps see for a moment something I
                          could only describe as a grey veil for
                          a small moment. If you have an explanation
                          please send me a mail.

                          At one step of the long staircase are small
                          strange light effects though I can't see any
                          difference of construction to the other steps,
                          so I darkened the whole area.
