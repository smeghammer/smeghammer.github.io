DESCRIPTION:

	DMGRAPH will store graphics into or extract graphics from DOOM WAD 
	and PWAD files, in GIF or PPM formats.  Graphic format type is 
	controlled by the filename suffix, or by using the '-T' option on 
	the command line.

        Patch WAD files (PWAD) can be edited the same as WAD files by using
        the '-f pwad' option on the command line; the PWAD will be created
        as needed.  There are, however, some limitations.  Four	types of 
	graphics are found in a WAD: 

		type 0: miscellaneous
		type 1: sprite
		type 2: wall texture
		type 3: floor texture

	Only graphic types 0 and 2 can be put into a PWAD.  Sprites
	and floor textures, if put into a PWAD, will either be ignored
	by DOOM, or cause it to abort.

	To remove a graphic from the PWAD, use the '-r' option.
        For the PWAD to work correctly, the filename must end with .WAD.

	Input graphics should have a resolution of 320x200 or less.
	To indicate transparent areas in the graphic, draw with
	Cyan (red:0, green:255, blue:255). 

	Placement of the graphic can be adjusted with the '-i' option.
	When a graphic is extracted, it's current insertion point
	is stored in the GIF or PPM file.  Negative insertion points, 
        used on some graphics, indicate an absolute coordinate from the 
        top-left of the screen.

	Some graphics are sensitive to size or placement.  For example,
	TITLEPIC will generate a 'Bad V_DrawPatch' error if the 
	insertion point isn't 0,0; STFGOD0 must be no larger
	than 31x31; etc.

	Please be sure to have a backup copy of the original DOOM WAD data.

	
	Some examples:

	Extract SKY1 graphic in GIF format:

		DMGRPAH SKY1 -e sky1.gif


	Store SKY1 graphic in a PWAD:

		DMGRAPH SKY1 -f graph.wad -s sky1.gif
