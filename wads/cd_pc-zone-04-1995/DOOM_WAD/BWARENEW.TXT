Quick Notes on Gameplay :    A very detailed WAD, complete with well-matched       
                             textures, many lifts, many switches and linedefs
                             to trigger floors and brighten or darken light 
                             levels.  Nearly EVERY sector has a tag to SOME 
                             line definition to do SOMETHING!  Enjoy the huge
                             staircase into the deep poison dungeon, the 
                             "Outer Perimeter", the false wall Cove into the 
                             dark prison bars, the beginning "Cross-hair" 
                             lift sectors, the Imp teleportation zone, and a
                             hell of a lot more!!  Beware...

            * There are places where a quick-running DOOM hero must "jump"
              across gaps between ledges and sectors!  By "jump" I mean, hold
              down the shift key (or whatever key it is you use to make the
              marine run) and boogey across a gap as if it weren't there.

              It is only NECESSARY and REQUIRED to do this ONCE in the level.
              Other places are merely for fun, or score you added bonuses.

============================================================================
      * There IS a storyline to this wad at the end of this text file!!
        (If you wish to read it, go for it, but it is not REALLY short.)
============================================================================

Interesting  :    * Very long, deep staircase into a poison dungeon that
 Features           is full of barrels, purgeable creatures, and a few
                    switches to keep you busy between shells & cells
                        
                  * Different objects appear on different skill levels:
                    
                    1. Creatures, decor, bonuses all slightly
                       differ from skill to skill
                    2. "Hurt Me Plenty" differs very much from 
                       "Ultra-Violence" -- creatures appear in
                       different locations, some entirely new
                    3. Retrieving weapons becomes a task from
                       skill to skill as they are placed differently

                  * Light levels in nearly every sector can darken or
                    fill up with light, changing the appearance of each
                    room, sector and area: trip the correct linedef (with
                    or without knowing... ;)  and you may not recognize
                    that sector you went through 2 minutes before!
                  
                  * Over 10 DEATHMATCH startup locations
                  
                  * Beginning lift creates illusion that there
                    are sectors on TOP of sectors (which can't occur in DOOM)
                        
                  * Possibility of achieving each and EVERY Weapon 
                    offered in game, on both DEATHMATCH & 1-player mode:

                    No more chinsy excuses from authors of Wads who keep the
                    weapons from you, expecting you to dust a Caco with a 
                    pop-gun or Fist-O-rama!!  Screw stuff like that!  Your 
                    only chance in THIS wad is to FIND all the weapons!  
                    If they WEREN'T there, you wouldn't be be-waring, you'd 
                    be-RUNNIN'!
                
                  * Immense REVERSED teleportation zone which sends creatures 
                    and players all over this huge room--fun on DEATHMATCH
                          ( You can even shoot yourself with   )
                          ( your OWN missile!  Sorry, your own )
                          ( BFG doesn't hurt you--hehehehehehe )

                  * Over 660 objects total in wad!
                    (That's including decorations, creatures, teleport exits,
                     and the like... don't worry; there AREN'T 660 Cacos!!)

                  * Nearly ALL of the 380 sectors that make up BEWARE are
                    tagged to some linedef so that they darken by a step,
                    lift with a switch, brighten as you go, frighten as you
                    play, and change the whole level's appearance around

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time allotted for       :       OVER 120 hours (really).  This is my second
creation of map                 WAD, and I've been fooling around adding and
                                deleting and fixing and changing it for about
                                a month or so.  I just spent about an hour or 
                                so each day trying to improve it, and I think 
                                it's definitely a keeper!  Enjoy it!

THE STORY BEHIND "BEWARE":

  You can hear only your breath.  This suit isn't much, but it's better than
sucking on the simple nothing that space is made of.  A lump in your throat 
forms as you recall the silence just before... this.  The silence in Grainer's 
realization that things were no longer in control... yours, his, or even 
McCarter's... maybe not even God's...

  And if God's responsible for THIS one, you wonder what IN BEELZEBUB'S name
he was THINKING, and what the MORAL of this horrifying disaster is...

  As you float into the ex-space station that was once called ILSA, you recap 
everything that you remember--you thank the UAC for making log recorders able 
to be hooked up while in an air-tight space suit, and try to describe just
exactly what took place on the Magellan before she went down.  You figure, 
"If I don't make it, at least what happened will..." 

  You pause only to secure your feet to ILSA with the G-boots you equipped
yourself with in your spastic frenzy to save your crew.
  
  And with a deep breath, you begin at the beginning... the Light Anomaly-- 
  
  ...everything that happened... those last few minutes... what happened... 
to you, Davis, Gary, Grainer: all in a matter of a few measely parsecs, 
minutes and adrenaline burning events which you'll never forget... 

  IF you live through this.

================================== ******* ==================================

Davis:  "I'll just be glad when we've completed ILSA.  She'll be one hell of a 
        great station and all, but I'm tired of breathin' man-made air!  I
        want to get the f*@k off this hunk of tin ship and go home!"

One of the boys: "Hey, Magellan's no hunk!!  She's a gem!  More than I can
                  say for Kendra....!"

(Friendly, kind-hearted joking laughter from the tables in the Meal Sector)

Davis:  "Cute... Real cute, guys... a gem, huh?  How 'bout a mouth FULL of
         gems?!  My fist'll arrange that!  Heh-heh... damn bums..."

(Friendly chuckles and mumbles about Davis from the boys)

Gary:  "Earth, huh... you want to go back to Earth?"

Davis: "Hell, yes!.... What, I'd suppose YOU want to live on the station?!"

Gary:  "No, no!  Not LIVE on ILSA, but at least take an assignment on her!"

Davis: "Gary, you don't even know what ILSA stands for!  How can ya say you
        want to ensign there?  You just stick to being on Captain --YOUR 
        NAME--'s ship, and MAYBE he won't 'demote your sorry ass'!  Heh-heh."

(Laughter from the boys in the Meal Sector)

The Boys: "Ha-ha, Davis.  'Demote your sorry ass'-- nice one."

*** (YOU, the space marine Captain of the UAC ship Magellan enter ***
***  quietly, overhearing the boys' argument)                     ***

Gary:  "Aw, sh*t, Davis... I KNOW what ILSA is all about..."
Davis: "Okay, brainiac, what's the 'I' for? Heh-heh..."

(More chuckles)

Gary:  "Okay, very funny... 'I' stands for Interplanetary: can I get a drink
        of water, Mrs. Davis?  Do I need a bathroom access card??"

(Rolling against Davis with the laughter)

Davis: "Cute;  It just so happens that General McCarter named his daughter
        ELSA, and thass why they call the new station that, Gare..." 

You:   "For BOTH of your information, Davis... Gary.... McCarter's WIFE is, or
        rather WAS named Elsa before she died.  The station's name just came
        out that way, and it was kind of nice that it resembled Tom McCarter's
        wife's name... ILSA... Interplanetary Linking Satellite Archive.  Elsa
        was a hell of a lady, or so I hear from old Tommy... I saw her picture
        once; lemme tell you-- she was drop-dead gorgeous.  Tom said her dream
        was to make information from planet to planet accessible to all--to
        somehow link information that was worldwide right through space.  A
        sort of Planetary Internet, I guess.  
        
        Look, I don't want to be a kill-joy, and I never met her, 
        but I want this station to be a success."

(Pause.  The crew is somewhat struck by your sudden sappiness.)

Davis: "Aw, Cap why do you have to go and get sappy on us?  I ain't never
        seen you give us no "speech" before like this?"

You:   "Jesus, Davis, I'm NOT opening up a 'let's explore our feelings'
        session, I just think we ought to give McCarter's wife-God rest her
        soul-some respect!  This station is not just ANOTHER assignment,
        Davis... McCarter's been our Big Sarge for a little less than two
        hands worth of fingers to count in years!"

One of the boys: "Cap, you know Davis can't count that high...."

(Laughter)

You:   "Heh-heh... Davis, I know you want off this assignment... I mean, I
        understa... I... Davis, what is your wife's nam..."
Davis: "...Oh, Kendra, Captain --YOUR NAME--, Kendra..."
The Boys : "the GEM...."
You:   "..RIGHT!  Kendra.  Anyway, I know she's probably as anxious to see
        you as you are to see her, bu.."

=============================================================================
(A sudden wisp of light flashes through the Meal Sector, blinding the entire
 room of crew members for a second, as if a beam of light with the intensity
 of a small sun had rolled over the area.  The ship is lightly shaken.)
=============================================================================

Davis: "What th..."
The Boys: "Hey.. Wh.. Holy Sh... Ay..."

(The lights dim slightly during the confusion...)

Voice over your communicator: "Captain..."

You:   "Status, Mr. Grainer!  What happened?"

Voice of Grainer: "Captain, I'm not sure... for a moment, we had something
                   that basically resembled a... well a... (long pause)"

You:   "Go on, Mark..."

Voice of Grainer: "Well... I hope you know what I mean Captain, if I say
                   we had what resembled a.. 'power surge'."

You:   "A powe.. a sur..., Mark you can't be serious..."

Voice of Grainer: "Aye Sir, I know it's 99.9 percent impossible after 2207, 
                   when Professor and scientist James D. Jen..." 

You:   "..I know, Grainer... James D. Jenkins solved the problem of surges,
        anomalies and other power abnormalities greater than 2048-ei and
        less than 4194304-ei through a specific formula to control the
        current and source of energy...  But how, then did th..."

Voice of Grainer: "I don't know, sir."

(You are not amused.  What seemed to have happened HASN'T HAPPENED for nearly
 one-hundred and fifty YEARS!!!  How could a surge occur on a spaceship?
 A couple hundred years ago, this was no big thrill, but on a spaceship that
 packs the power of over 1200000-ei, a SURGE makes a laser blast look pretty
 pathetic in terms of brightness... AND destructive force!)

(The ship is rocked once more, the flash and shake even brighter this time.)

You:    "STATUS, GRAINER!!  HANSON, RAENER, BOYER--BRIDGE!"

(Your bridge crew scrambles for the compression lifts...)

Voice of Grainer: "CAPTAIN, WE'VE LOST AUTO-PILOT!  LOOKS LIKE LUNCH IS OVER!
                   I NEED SOME HANDS DOWN HERE!  CLASS 3 ELECTRICAL DISTUR-
                   BANCE ON THE BOARDS!!!  REPEAT-- ASSISTANCE REQUIRED!!"

You:    "GARY, DAVIS, ATTEND TO MR. GRAINER IN ENGINEERING!"

(Frantically, as the preceding dialogue overlapped generously, you rush your
 way through the dimly lit ship, up a lift to the bridge.)

(Helmsman Erikson meets you just as you arrive from the lift, reporting the 
 ship's situation in respect to ILSA...)

Erikson: "ERIKSON REPORTING, SIR.  ILSA STATION HAS UNDERGONE SOME MASSIVE
          POWER ANOMALIES... EQUIVALENT TO EXPLOSIVE BLASTS OF RANDOM ENERGY
          THAT HAVE THROWN IT OUT OF ORBIT AROUND MARS!  SHE'S DRIFTING."

You:     "Are we still maintaining orbit, and if so, can we pursue ILSA?"

Erikson: "CAPTAIN...."

(HE GRABS YOUR ARM)

You:     "What?  What... What is it?!"

Erikson: "The Magellan is no longe...."

Voice of Grainer: "CAPTAIN!  THE SHIP'S NOT RESPONDING!  WHAT THE HELL
                   HAPPENED TO DAVIS AND GARY?!!  THIS CAN'T BE HAPPENING!
                   THERE IS  N O  FUCKING WAY THE SHIPS DRIVER CONTROL COULD
                   HAVE BEEN LOST.... CAPTAIN, YOU'LL HAVE NO CONTROL OVER
                   THE SHIP FROM THE BRIDGE... I... OH SHIT, OH SHIT.... 
                   ONLY SIX MINU...
                   
                   (No breath)

                   --your name--....

                   ..... There's nothing more we can do... We're headed
                   directly toward Mars' atmosphere... there's not even
                   enough time to reach the shuttles before Magel...

You:     "The    H E L L   there ISN'T MISTER!!!  YOU GET YOUR ASS IN GEAR,
          OR I'LL DEMOTE YOUR PATHETIC ASS!!!  MOVE IT!!!
          
          M O V E  your ASS!!  GO, GO!!  MOVE  A S S !!!"

Over intercom:  "DOCKING--- ALL STATIONS, ALL FLOORS, THIS IS EVAC 5,

                 THIS IS NO FUCKING DRILL, AND I WILL NOT, REPEAT  N O T
                 REPEAT THIS MESSAGE!!!  DOCKING.... MOVE NOW.... EVAC 5

                         E V A C   5---    N O W !!"
                                           -----
(In a whirlwind of commotion, in an emergency evac-situation never even
 practiced in UAC Marine/Cadet training school, you attempt every effort to
 get your crew the hell off the Magellan before it's all over.  The G-forces
 alone would smash the crew's bones like grapevines if the Magellan entered
 the atmosphere of Mars without proper entry.

 The biggest problem remains... who will survive, and who will not... as you
 barked out the EVAC 5 order, you knew that not everyone would make it off
 the ship in time: ... Jesus... only four minutes left after the crew was 
 notified and in gear.  Record time for carrying out a full ship order-- one 
 minute, fifty-six seconds.)

 Dammit, though, it's not enough!  Oh, Christ why my crew...

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 *** You're not sure if Davis made it.....  --------------- (player 2)

 *** You're not sure if Erikson made it...  --------------- (player 3)

 *** You're not sure if Grainer made it...  --------------- (player 4)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 But...

 Unfortunately, you know YOU made it.

 Allowing as many crew members per shuttle as possible, you jettisoned your-
 self with the garbage cell, full-clad in gravity boots, a space suit and
 helmet, complete with a 4-day air supply, and three meals of food--hopefully
 your crewmates will navigate to Mars, relay the disaster to UAC, and send
 a patrol to find you for the 50 parsecs you could possibly travel with the
 damn garbage unit.

 You surmise that your chances of being rescued are grim.  You know one thing
 though... you'll be sure to mention that record-timing full-ship EVAC in
 your log.  Damn proud.  Damn sorry.  You hope to God somehow all of the
 crew made it somewhere, anywhere, anyplace, anyplanet safely.

 You'll have a lot of time to record what happened in the log recorder while
 you're on the garbage un...

 But WAIT!!

 The garbage unit... of COURSE!  Well, how the hell ELSE would it get
 clea... (!) You suddenly remember: Every garbage unit HAS to have a homing
 device to eventually be RECEIVED by a space station, and flown to Jupiter,
 where a WM SpaceBlock can hold the refuse!  So, you don't even have to
 WORRY about being sent for--you'll just hang on the the garbage cell, float
 on its sub-sub-warp power to the nearest..... space.. sta... 
 
 (In the distance, a glowing, randomly flashing space station ILSA looms,
 drifting further and further from orbit around Mars.)

                Oh.... shit.
 
 The nearest space station is... ILSA.

 WELL, but.... they... well they WOULDN'T have the GARBAGE units running if..
 ...if, uh... the... station wasn't.. running, right?


 Right?



                        Um,.... right?



 Terrified, you wonder what anomalies occurred in the ILSA station....  

 You KNOW you'll eventually land there...
 You KNOW the garbage unit MUST be working since they were building...
 You KNOW because you were just THERE about 48 hours ago!


 *** Now, if you could only REMEMBER where the small armouries all about
     ILSA were... you knew they were preparing the station to be able to
     defend itself.  You just KNOW it's through some UAC door, at the top
     of the cross-hair lift... 

 You cock your head back as well as you can to see your unstable Magellan
 behind you.  From this distance, you couldn't possibly make out if any
 shuttles were anywhere near, or even jettisoned.

 In a flash of red and white flame, your ship is lost, and you eventually 
 lose sight of the largest pieces of wrecka... Oh... Oh my god....

 You see the tortured remains of Ensign Gary floating through the darkness of
 space, limp and lifeless.  It was just plain unjust for him to have to die
