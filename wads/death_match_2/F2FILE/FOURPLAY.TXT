Fourplay is the first release in my series of four player deathmatch WAD's
for DOOM II. They are recommended for four players but two will suffice.
I recommend a 486/50 for play as some of the line of sight calculations
(Skulker - MAP02) get a bit crazy. I have run REJECT on all of the maps
for optimizations. This WAD replaces MAP01-03.

 Note! All levels are co-operative exits. If you don't like co-op exits,
 then these levels aren't for you.

Misc. Author Info       : Crazed and devoted DOOM nut in search of the
                          "perfect" four player deathmatch WAD. Spends more
                          time doing DOOM related things (writing DOOMLoad,
                          making WAD's, reading alt.games.doom) than would
                          like to admit. Thanx to my ever loving significant
                          other for understanding this crazy obsession of
                          mine (and for not spending more time with her
                          after work... :) )
Description             : In the spirit of LEDGES comes this all out
                          deathmatch slugfest. All weapons are present, but
                          are situated in such a place that going for them,
                          puts the player at a perfect position to be
                          fragged by other players. GET THE WEAPONS AND RUN!
                          ALOT of time has been spent figuring out the
                          layout to be in such a way that it makes for a FAST
                          paced game and there are minimal "skulking" 
                          positions. Don't stand around! You'll get fragged!
                          The exit requires two people to complete the board.
                          One person to press a switch, and another person to
                          use the lift. I've added a half-dozen imps around 
                          the board for a bit of variety but you may wish to
                          use -nomonsters, or for real fun, use -respawn.
                          HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR -altdeath PLAY!!!

                          3 Archviles were thrown in for fun...

                          (Did I forget to mention that you start off with                          
                          the chainsaw and shotgun... :)

Misc. Author Info       : Incurable DOOM addict who spends much to much time
                          playing DOOM much to the chagrin of my ever loving
                          :) SO

Description             : Ever play games like Photon, or Laser Quest? Games
                          Where you and 20 of your friends enter a dark
                          warehouse-like place armed with infra-red guns
                          and chest packs and run around trying to shoot each
                          other? I've tried to capture the same spirit in
                          Skulker. Recommended for 4 player net play, but will
                          "play" ok with 2 people over serial link, although
                          there will be times where, with two players, you'll
                          be hunting each other down for two or three minutes
                          at a time without firing a shot. The term "So close
                          yet so far away" fits perfectly.

                          capture the spirit of ZZone, but came up with
