Foxhole.wad is my first published attempt at a deathmatch wad.
It's small enough for 2 player, but is excellent for 3 and 4 player
deathmatches.

Title                   : Foxholes 'R' Us
Filename                : FOXHOLE.WAD
Author                  : Brian Monroe
Email Address           : monroeb@essex.hsc.colorado.edu
Misc. Author Info       : Love fast cars, big houses, and wants to be
                          just like Jack Daughery.
Description             : 3 big rooms connected like a cloverleaf.
                          Most of the items of value are located in
                          various "foxholes" (that you can't just run
                          past...you gotta slow down) or on top of
                          or behind pillars that lower when players
                          cross certain areas (kind of an interesting
                          way to find out where people are...hint)
                          There are a few side tunnels, and a pair
                          of teleports.

                          This is one level you may wish to play
                          WITH monsters.  The pillar in the middle
                          (between the 2 bigger rooms) will have a
                          single CYBERDEMON on it, who will act as a
                          sniper whilst the players try to duck and
                          dodge.  He's the only monster, and he's
                          not that hard to kill (if'n ya know how...)

Additional Credits to   : Everyone in my office who sacrificed lunch to
                          play (right.  sacrificed), everyone in my
                          Networking class who played, and everyone
                          on #IDOOM on IRC.  BTW, Khan, this one's
                          for you.  No BFG on skills 1-3, so stop
                          crying  ;)
