Misc. Author Info       : Just another chemistry graduate student
                          that loves to play doom.
Description             : This DOOM II pwad was designed specifically 
                          with 2-player Deathmatch 2.0 in mind.
                          It features MANY different sector heights,
                          good sniper spots, and some dark corners to
                          hide in.  All weapons are present except the
                          BFG (I don't like it in deathmatch).
                          There are just enough monsters to keep
                          things interesting.  If you don't like
                          the number of weapons available (or the
                          number/type of monsters) try a different
                          difficulty setting.  Plays great with
                          -respawn!!  This level has a cooperative 
                          exit.

Additional Credits to   : Chris Kuhl (sp?)  He gave his life many
                          times while beta testing.  :)
