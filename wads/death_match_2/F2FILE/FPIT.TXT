Title          : Fpit.wad
Author         : Tony Birge (73075,651)
Description    : My first (successful) attempt at a decent wad. Not the best 
		 But i love kicking my stepbrothers butt in deathmatch play. 
		 A hidden wall, two crushing ceilings and an armory that 
		 spoils the fun unless your opponent doesnt know about it.      
Additional Help: No one but little old me and three days of time b-4 skewl

I dont care just dont sell it unless you plan on giving all the money to me 
or else I will sue you for a hundred times what you made.<G>  Other than that 
(I really dont expect anyone to want to buy it anyway) do whatever you 
want...But if you edit it and put it back on the net notify me.
