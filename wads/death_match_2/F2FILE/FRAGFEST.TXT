Misc. Author Info       : I like Doom...Nuff said!

Description             : It's for Deathmatch.  This is an updated version of
                          andywad.zip.  It contains some cosmetic changes that
                          caused major HOM effects in the Dark Red Room(tm;).
                          The doors are correct size (X and Y).  Fixed that
                          one door where you couldn't open it up from the in-
                          side (where the plasma gun is) because it was not a 
                          repeatable linedef (could only do it once).

Additional Credits to   : Jeff Rabenhorst (For Edmap), id Software (for Doom), 
                          Colin Reed (BSP1.2).
