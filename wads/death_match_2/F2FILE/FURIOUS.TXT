Description             : This PWAD is a mod of the original E1M1 mission
                          in DOOM that has been revamped for OPTIMUM
                          DOOM2 deathmatch play.  Yea, I know, you're 
                          thinking "Oh great, another E1M1 mod...", but
                          trust me, this one is GREAT for DM. Over 30 hours of 
                          playtesting on a 4 player network has contributed
                          to making this level a superior Deathmatch PWAD.

Additional Credits to   : Bob Baum, Dave King and Scott West for thier
                          playtesting and input.
                          John Romero, for original design of the level
                          and ID Software for the game we all love to play.
                          Kenneth S. Forte for the great sound FX.  Check
                          out his sound PWAD, YADSPWAD, it's great.
