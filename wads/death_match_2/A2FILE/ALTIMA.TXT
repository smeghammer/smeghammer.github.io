Misc. Author Info       : First attempt at building a wad
			  file for doom. Designed for deathmatch.
			  It was not designed for shy (cowards) or 
			  snipers it was designed for aggressive
			  players who want to have fun !!!!!!!!!
			  It is great for practicing various
			  moves in open and closed areas. Plenty
			  of weapons, ammo, armor, and health 
			  to allow for fair and continuous slaying. 
			  Has a few monsters and soldiers for 
			  added challenge.

Description             : Deathmatch. Would welcome any comments.
