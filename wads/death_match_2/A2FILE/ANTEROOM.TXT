Email Address           : ebynum@cs.jhu.edu. This will change very
			  soon, most likely to bynum@cs.colostate.edu

Misc. Author Info       : Graduate of Johns Hopkins' CS Dept., soon
			  to be CS grad at Colorado State (8/22/94).
			  Finger my account (ebynum@server.cs.jhu.edu) for
			  a wise and unambiguous Jack London quotation.

Description :             This is a somewhat large level, so named for its
			  central room with the large spiral staircase,
			  replete with divers* weapons and sundry monsters.
			  All secret doors have slight texture offsets, and
			  there's a computer map behind one of them. I
			  included every weapon at least once, and you'll
			  find each kind of monster save the Cyberdemon and
			  Spiderdemon somewhere in the level.

			  One room is reminiscent of Raiders of the Lost Ark
			  (hint: lite-amp visors aren't always a good thing
			  to have!). Another has three pillars in it; your
			  selected skill level determines which one is your
			  teleport destination. I have not played every WAD
			  out there, so I think this is the first one to
			  implement such a feature. There are a few wide-open
			  areas suited especially for deathmatch play, and
			  a preponderance of plasma rifles strewn about the
			  level for quick rearming. Every room has at least
			  one exit, including the lava pit outside (i.e.,
			  there are no "traps," per se).

			  If you enjoy this WAD, please email me and let me
			  know what you liked about it, and also where you
			  found this file (I'm curious to see how far its
			  range grows). If you don't like this WAD, don't
			  bother telling me, as I daresay I shan't have much
			  time in grad school to fool around with level
			  creation and fix what you thought I should have
			  done.  Finally, if you're a student at Colorado
			  State, please look me up when I get there - I've
			  never been to Colorado and I'd like some fellow
			  Doomers to show me around!

* Construction *

Base                    : New level from scratch

Editor(s) used          : DoomCAD 4.3 for all of the construction
			  (that cut-and-paste template is invaluable).
			  DoomED 2.60b for the texture previewer.
			  BSP12x for node building.

Development Time        : Three weeks, averaging about five hours per day.
			  This included learning the editor and re-
			  constructing sections that failed integrity
			  checks. 

Known Bugs              : Some of the monsters get "stuck" in doorways:
			  they'll just walk into the doorjamb instead
			  of coming after you. This is not all that
			  common an occurrence, but it's darn annoying
			  when it does happen.

* This is not a misspelling of "diverse." Both divers and sundry are
synonyms for "various." Jack London uses the former term a good deal in
his works, so I have incorporated it into mine. My writing tends more
towards the pedantic than the pedestrian, a trait neither common nor
warranted in computer scientists.
