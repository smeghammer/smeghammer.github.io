			  any of 'em <g>);

			: And, of course, those id guys. (You and Quinet owe
			  my wife a BIG apology. But you have MY regards.)

Description             : As in my first level -- DANTE'S GATE -- I have tried
			  in CROSSING ACHERON to achieve a gaming atmosphere
			  that is not only fast-paced (once the fur starts to
			  fly), but just plain creepy. Once again, I went for
			  the aesthetics (you know: The Look); but this time,
			  I also tried to keep the game from being too
			  easy. I think once you get inside, you'll find that
			  CROSSING ACHERON has been fully optimized for
			  DEATHMATCH.  But it's just as enjoyable (if I do say
			  so myself) in Single-player and Co”perative modes.

			  CROSSING ACHERON (pronounced 'ak eron) is a sequel
			  to DANTE'S GATE -- thematically, anyway.  (It's an 
			  E1M3 only because I thought the music was more
			  appropriate than M2.) For any of the two or three 
			  of you out there who have read Dante Alighieri's 
			  THE DIVINE COMEDY -- or even only "Inferno" -- 
			  I'm sure you've been able to appreciate the many 
			  allusions to this work in DOOM. I have tried to 
			  take a tack of my own along the same lines. (I do
			  this not only because I think the idea is neat, but
			  so that people will think that I'm very clever.)
			  I'm not so na‹ve as to expect everyone to rush out
			  and get a copy of "Inferno" (I mean, it IS pretty
			  tedious stuff, at times), but it's well worth the
			  read -- and a little patience is a virtue that is
			  often well-rewarded.

			  (By the way: Acheron is a river in Hell (basically).
			  But don't look for any rivers in here: I tried it
			  several different ways and just wasn't convinced.)

			  I thank those of you who sent me mail on my previous
			  effort, and I hope to hear from more of you about
			  this one.  (Just a line would do: "It's great!"
			  or "It sucks!" or "Now I know what John Cormack
			  MEANT to do in "Unholy Cathedral.")

			  Thanks.  Hope you like it.

Instructions		: Put ACHERON.WAD in your DOOM directory, type
			  "doom -devparm -file acheron.wad -wart 1 3 -skill <#>"
			  (Or, to play moderately at first, also put the file
			  ACHE.BAT in your DOOM directory and type ACHE.  And
			  you'll get one.)
  
Disclaimer		: I assume no responsibility for anything of any sort
			  in any way, shape, or form -- now, then, henceforeward, 
			  in this life (or the next several) for any screw-ups
			  or even minor inconveniences this PWAD causes you,
			  your family, your relatives, friends, ancestors,
			  associates, employers, pets, neighbors, lovers,
			  congressional representatives, nor any other person --
			  living, dead, or undead -- that you have or will ever
			  have any contact with in even the slightest form.
			  This PWAD has been tested and tested ad infinitum, so
			  it shouldn't mess with your computer or anything else
			  remotely associated with it.  But if it DOES, then
			  that's the way the cookie crumbles.  Don't come cryin'
			  to me.  It must be something YOU did.  If you don't
			  like it, lump it. (I ran out of clich‚s.)
