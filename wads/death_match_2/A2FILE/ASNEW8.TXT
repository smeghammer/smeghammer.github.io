* Misc Notes *

This level, in its eighth incarnation, is the product of many, many
lunchtime deathmatches.  The subtle refinement  in  every stage  of
development,  is  obvious  to  the  few who have seen each version.

There are several methods we have used to play this level.  For 2 
person deathmatches, we suggest the following:

-skill 5 -altdeath -nomonsters  :recommended
-skill 4 -altdeath -respawn     :go ahead, try and hide !

For solo play, we suggest
 
-skill 5 -altdeath , and try to get each weapon once before leaving
                     level

For 4 way play, we suggest
 
-skill 5 -altdeath -nomonsters
 
We are of the opinion, as are many who have seen this level, that 
this is the best deathmatch level yet made in Kingston, Ont.
(thats in Canada, for all you Geographically-Challanged Yankees.)
