Description             : My apartment, just like the title says! (DOOM ][)
			  This is my first attempt at making a PWAD, so
			  be kind.  BTW, my apartment is in Tampa, FL, near
			  the Univ. of South Florida, where I am a Mech.
			  Engineering Grad. Student.  I started with the
			  intent of making a DM only level, but put some
			  monstas and an exit in for the hell of it.
Additional Credits to   : Jason Hinders and Layne Brunk for helping test
			  this thing.
