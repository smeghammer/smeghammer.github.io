Description             : This level is based on my work place. Its pretty
			  accurate except for the northern part of the
			  building.  I took an artistic detour here, there
			  would have been too many 2 sided linedefs in 
			  this area with all the machinery.

Additional Credits to   : The makers of DOOM ... id software! The authors
			  of Deu 5.21GCC and all previous versions. The
			  author of BSP11.exe and to the person that ported
			  IDBSP.exe I owe a debt of thanks!
			  Well done guys! and um ... Girls? :)

			  2 months.

Known Bugs              : No bugs!
 			  No HOM! ( I lied, I did find HOM but you have to
			  stand in a particular spot, and it is not very
			  big! )
			  - You can save this game now. Originally I had so
			    many THINGS in it that it would crash when trying
 			    to save it. I figure the number of THINGS that you
			    can have in a wad is about 500. I had it to 540
			    and it still crashed so now the number of THINGS
			    is down to about 490.	
			  - Please if you find any bugs drop me a note!
