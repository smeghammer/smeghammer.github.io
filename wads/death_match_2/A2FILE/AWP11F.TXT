Misc. Author Info       : This is my 2nd PWAD, hope you enjoy
                          it.
                          
Description             : The original version of this PWAD (AWP11.WAD)
                          had several bugs, and was not quite as
                          complete as it should have been.  There was
                          an intermediate version (AWP11E.WAD) which
                          _should_ never have been released, i don't
                          know if it leaked out, but if you see it
                          or have it, just delete it.  This is the
                          FINAL version (as the name says) and i
                          will not redo this one again, even if
                          there is some big huge bug that makes it
                          not work on anyone else's computer.  (i
                          assure you it works fine on mine.)  so, i
                          hope you like it.  i enjoyed making it,
                          because i finished learning DEU while making
                          this level.
                          NOTE ; per id's request (and out of common
                          decency) this level WILL NOT work on the
                          shareware version..(duh..)
