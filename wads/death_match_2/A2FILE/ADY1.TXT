ADY1.WAD
--------
DOOM! PWAD Created by Adrian Speight in the Summer of 94
I hope this is fun for you to play. I enjoyed making it

Please do NOT use it as a basis for other levels - I design
my levels as complete ideas and not building blocks

Replaces E1M1 - registered version only due to weapons

Skill levels ARE implemented
Works well in single player
Works well in Cooperative play
Not an ideal deathmatch level, but there ARE deathmatch starts

Ady1.wad - This is my first go at a WAD. You have been sentenced
to death by firing squad (even in 4 player coop - there are 2
execution chambers). There is no apparent way out and lots of
soldiers to kills you. If you DO get out, there are monsters and
a maze. All you have is your beretta hidden down your Y-Fronts.
This is a hell of a difficult start situation for Ultra Violence,
but if you get out you'll thirst for revenge, and the rest of the WAD
is for that. Eventually you may be able to storm the fortress of the
creeps who decided to off you and give them what they deserve.
There is some pretty scenery too, and a few sneaky traps.
