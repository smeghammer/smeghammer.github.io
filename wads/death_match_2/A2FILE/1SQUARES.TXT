Email Address           : rothman@cs.concordia.ca (don't have one so I'm 
                          using a friend's)
Misc. Author Info       : This is my first doom wad, took 25 hours to 
                          complete

Description             : This is extremly hard if not impossible to complete
                          on the hard level. the only bug I know of is that 
                          you can't save it on the hardest level.
