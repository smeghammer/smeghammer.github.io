     "The Gallery" was my first finished DOOM level using the DOOM
     editing utilities (DEU) version 5.0.  Although it's a simple
     level, and not too hard to beat, I keep getting drawn back to
     it for some reason.  I built it as an exercise in "limited
     resources".  This means that you're likely to run out of ammo
     before you run out of enemies, so make every shot count.
     (And watch those corners!)
