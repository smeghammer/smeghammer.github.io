Misc. Author Info       : First level from scratch, but don't let that keep 
			  you from trying it.

Comments?               : Please email me if you like this...let me know
                          what you think...suggestions, complaints,etc.                          and carnage are on their way!

Description             : This level was designed with single player in mind, 
			  but it has proven to be a decent deathmatch wad as 
			  well.  It has mucho carnage even at "Hurt me wimpy."
			  All weapons, keys, and enemies are used.  This wad
			  is set up to replace map01, but it would actually
			  make a good replacement for "Tricks and Traps,"
			  if you know what I mean.  
                          
Additional Credits to   : Matthew Ayres, the author of WADED, and of course,
			  the id guys.
