This is a simple example of a modified level created with the registered
version of Renegade Graphics DoomED (RGDMED).  Parts of this level have
been heavily modified while others have not been touched and are 
easily recognized.  Gameplay is good, try it at Ultra!

To use this file copy it to your doom directory, then start Doom by 
typeing:

DOOM -FILE E1M1.WAD

That's all there is to it.  This file is what is known as a PWAD file.  It
contains a single extra level that overwrites (in memory only!) a particular
level.  Multiple PWAD files can be used at once to provide an entirely
new Episode.
