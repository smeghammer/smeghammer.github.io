Totaly NEW level for DOOM. Used DEU v5 Beta4 to remap! 
This level is not finished yet, but feel free to look 
around. There is no end-level switch, so you'll have 
to use IDCLEV to pass. This level took about 4 hours 
to build so far, and it is not _near_ done. When its 
done, it'll be good for both multi- and single-player
modes. Any comments or suggestions are welcome. Have 
fun!
