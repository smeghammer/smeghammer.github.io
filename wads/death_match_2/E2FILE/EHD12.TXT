Here are three levels that I am experimenting with..  Type GO and they
will automatically run for you.  They replace levels 1, 2, and 4.  I 
haven't finished the replacement for level 3 but I can work on that
one now.  (Nightmare level will be a real treat!).

They should all be Deathmatch ready as well, I strongly suggest level
4 for that.  

Added Note:  To fully experience these levels, DO NOT USE CHEAT CODES!
There is no exit to level 4, this will be added as I continue making 
levels.

Oh yeah, these were made with the best editor to date, DEU 5 beta.

Any comments, criticisms, suggestions (If you find anything messed up
like some walls (I'm still chasing them down at times)) Email me at

Now go kill!
