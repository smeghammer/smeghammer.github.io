Description             : UAC has been trying to stage a counter- 
			  attack on Hell, via the realms of
			  the four elements: Air, Water, Earth
			  and Fire.  The effort has gone awry,
			  the demons are winning, and you have
			  gone in to eliminate all opposition.

Known Bugs              : Occasional dark vertical lines with joined
			  partially transparent textures.  One instance of
			  the veil effect (hard to find, doesn't hurt play).
			  Funny transient falling floor effect in FIRE,
			  just a quirk of the DOOM engine, not really HOM.
			  [Note: Dshrink has been applied to these maps,
			  that makes this Pwad unsuitable for map editing. 
			  Anybody who wants the unshrunk maps to use, just
			  contact me via email.]
