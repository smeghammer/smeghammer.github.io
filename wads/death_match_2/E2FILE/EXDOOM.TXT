Misc. Author Info       : This is my 1ST PWAD, hope you enjoy
                          it. I have made other small levels
                          but this is my first real devastating
                          level.

Description             : E2M1 replacement PWAD. Named for the reason
                          of having to be really good at doom to play
                          this level.

===========================

    If you haven't played alot of doom then I recommend that you not play 
this level.  There are a few places that you will be instantly killed if 
don't know what you are doing.  You also need a pretty fast processor for
this level because of the size of some rooms.  There alot of open spaces 
which is ideal for death match.  This is a serious hack and slash level.
Oh, by the way "watch your back!!!!"
