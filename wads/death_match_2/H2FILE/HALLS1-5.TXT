Title                   : Halls of Death (Episode of deathmatch wads)
Filename                : halls1-5.wad (The 5 indicates that two levels
                          are ready. When we make more we'll release
                          halls1-6.wad and so on..)

Description             : These levels are designed especially for
                          deathmatch. They're great fun at even two
                          players games, but with a LOT of playtesting
                          we have found out that the more players you
                          have, the more fun :)
