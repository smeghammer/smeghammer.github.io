The story so far ...                   
===========================

After your escape from the Inferno Of Hell you are picked up by a team of 
marines. The site where you returned is secured and you are taken to a 
military facililty to report about your strange adventure. After many days of 
psychological tests and interrogation the investigators decide to believe your 
story (you don't have the feeling that they believe everything, but they gather
a team of scientists and special investigators for further research on that 
case). Your senior officers grant you a vacation of three weeks....
After your return from the vacation you are summoned to the office of the 
officer in charge of the special investigation team. He tells you that they 
have found the entrance to what they believe is some kind of catacombs. There 
they ran into a badly injured marine who claimed that he had escaped from a 
horrifying temple.
Before he died he said that many of his fellow soldiers are held as prisoners 
by a spider-like priestess, right under the site where you returned from the 
Inferno Of Hell. While unholy rites take place some marines have been tortured
to death, others are imprisoned in cells and are starving to death. After they
died their lost souls are still kept in these cells oozing in pain. He also 
reported about experiments, which turned the men into braindead creatures, who
spit fire and acid.
When he and some of his mates were brought to a room, which looked like a 
laboratory they managed to grab a gun and fought against the guards, marines
turned into zombies. Most of them died in this battle, only a small number of
them survived and tried to make their way out of the temple. But only he 
reached the surface and was picked up by the special investigation team.
The officer tells you that the man's wounds were deadly and that he died before
he could describe the way in and out. But the team has learned that there is
some kind of celebration room with stairs leading to a gate where the priestess
appeared to perform the terrifying rites. There must be some way to open this
gate to gain entrance to the area below.
As you are the only one experienced with these enemies your orders are to lead
a team of the best marines into this temple (and out again ?!). If there are 
still soldiers held as prisoners try to free them. Also try to get hold of 
those who have been turned into monsters. If this shows up to be impossible,
well, at least make them rest in peace. But your primary mission goal is to 
capture or kill the spider-like priestess.
You and five more marines are at the entrance to the catacombs, this time you 
are well armed and ready for action. However, your hands shake and you wish to 
be somewhere else far away from this place, but you are a marine, a marine with
orders, and you were taught to obey orders.
You climb down into the darkness of the catacombs and run along a corridor.
Everything seems to be fine when you and your team suddenly feel dizzy and
disoriented. After you regain control over your senses, your comrades lie dead
at your feet and almost all your weapons are gone. You hear an evil laughter
echoing in your head.
'Okay, bastards !', you say to yourself, 'Let's play it the tough way.'
You are ready to GIVE THEM HELL !!!
