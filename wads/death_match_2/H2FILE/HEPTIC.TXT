Description             : I did not build this level with a lot of tricks
                          and traps in mind, though there are a few of
                          them, but instead as a good old shotgun crawl.
                          You will have a variety of weapons to choose from
                          but you will have to use your resources wisely.
                          I tried to construct this level so that it can be
                          completed if you use your head as well as your
                          trigger finger.  Running around blasting wildly
                          at anything that moves may get you to the end of
                          the level, but it may leave you a little short-
                          handed to deal with what might be lurking there.
                          I hope you enjoy this level.  It took me a long
                          time to finish it (I am constantly refining and
                          touching up). I originally designed it for single
                          or cooperative, but I have included several death-
                          match starts and with the level's connectivity I
                          think that it could work fairly well in deathmatch.
                          Your responses are welcome and encouraged. Enjoy!!
