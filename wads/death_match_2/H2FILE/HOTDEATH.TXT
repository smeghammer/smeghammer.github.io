What's New?             : Added a new level (map 04), moved previous
                          map 04 to map 05.  Added a teleporter to level
                          2 in the secret room as to allow more than one
                          way out.

Description             : A compilation of my five g&r wads (2,3,4,5,6).
                          2 player, deathmatch ONLY, no monsters!
                          Designed for maximum carnage.  These wads are
                          not designed for those players who like to sit
                          and wait for their opponent, they are for the
                          hunter who enjoys the chase.

                          Note: You will not find a BFG ANYWHERE in these
                                levels.  All other weapons available.
