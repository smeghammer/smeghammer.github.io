Description             : As you gather your senses, you look 
                          around to see that you are in a small
                          courtyard.  You can see the exit, 
                          it is only a few yards away.  You move
                          towards the door only to find that
                          there is some type of a force field
                          preventing you from getting there.  
                          There must be some way out!  You find
                          the subterrainian passage.  You make
                          your way down deeper, deeper into the
                          heart of the complex.  You discover all
                          the secrets that it holds.  You find the 
                          Pyramid Chamber and climb to the top and
                          grab the exit key card.  You have fought
                          in the Arena of Death and survived!  You  
                          pick up your ticket and relax at the 
                          Double Feature Cinema just as the curtain 
                          goes up.  It is an adult movie but you get
                          in easily and sit front row center. You make
                          it back to the surface and fresh air.  You have
                          by-passed the force field, you insert the
                          keycard into the exit door, YES, the door
                          opens, you run in and see the switch on the
                          far wall.  As you reach for the switch you
                          feel something burning on the back of your
                          neck, should you turn around or press the
                          switch?  You start to turn and ............
