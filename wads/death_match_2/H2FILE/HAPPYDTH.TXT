Misc. Author Info       : I am a Computer Science major at Western Kentucky
                          University, and a long-time DOOM player.  This is
                          my first venture into actually distributing the
                          PWADs I make, as most of my other ones weren't
                          good enough to be distributed.  If you have any
                          comments (good or bad), suggestions, etc., please
                          drop me a line at the address above.

Description             : This level was designed as a deathmatch level.  It
                          can, however, be very challenging if you play it
                          one-player.  I was using a DeHacked version of
                          Doom2 while I made this, and it's set up for use
                          with it.  Without it, you'll probably want to use
                          the IDKFA code for ammo, since you're gonna run out
                          long before you kill the monsters.  This level lends
                          itself to mostly arena-style combat, which is my
                          favorite.

Additional Credits to   : Chris "Red" Schneider and Jason "Potsy" Poncerolli, 
                          along with the rest of the guys for their input, 
                          play testing, and encouragement, and Id software for 
                          making one of the best games on Earth (and in Hell.)

* Construction *

Base                    : New level from scratch  (Actually, I built from
                          S1.wad, one of the PWADs included with DEU.)
Editor(s) used          : ADE (an edited version of DEU)
Known Bugs              : There are some minor texture glitches in the smiley
                          rooms, and by the northeast teleporter in the square
                          arena.  They shouldn't bother gameplay, but if
                          anyone knows how to fix them, please send me some
                          e-mail.
