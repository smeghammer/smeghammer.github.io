Title                   : Halls of Death (Episode of deathmatch wads)
Filename                : halls1-6.wad (The 6 indicates that two levels
                          are ready. When we make more we'll release
                          halls1-7.wad and so on..)

Description             : These levels are designed especially for
                          deathmatch. They're great fun at even two
                          players games, but with a LOT of playtesting
                          we have found out that the more players you
                          have, the more fun :)

Level-specific notes:

E1M1, E1M2: There's a prison in both levels. If you walk over certain
linedefs you'll teleport to prison. You can't see out from there, but
your enemies WILL see you from outside, and then it's just a matter of
seconds until you're dead. So, run carefully ;-)

E1M4: There IS a way to exit on your own, but it's too hard for you to
figure out :) The first one to mail us a demo showing how he/she does it
gets his/her name on the next release of Halls of Death :)

Also, the first one to walk thru a certain doorway to a specific
direction gets teleported to a place where there is a lot of goodies
around. Including BFG. BUT, only one person can get there, and then it's
gone forever..

E1M6: The only weapons on medium/hard difficulty level are chaingun and
shotgun. At easy level, there's also a rocket launcher included.
