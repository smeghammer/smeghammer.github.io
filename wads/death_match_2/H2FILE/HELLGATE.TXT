Misc. Author Info       : New to the game, only started playing May '94.
                          Addicted totally to deathmatch games, enjoy killing
                          my work partners! (the usual intro!)

Description             : The UAC genius who developed the trans-dimensional
                          warp was believed killed during the fiasco on
                          Deimos. But it appears that he managed to escape,
                          using a new interplanetary teleporter! Even worse,
                          this man has made an evil pact with the forces of
                          evil - he is building a HellGate to transport 
                          hordes of demons and imps to take over the world. 
                          Our hero, the stolid marine, must put this menace 
                          to an end. Already, demonic troops stand guard 
                          over the complex where the unethical maniac has 
                          performed his fiendish work. You are dropped into 
                          the central compound at night. Your mission - 
                          destroy all opposition. Deactivate the HellGate!
