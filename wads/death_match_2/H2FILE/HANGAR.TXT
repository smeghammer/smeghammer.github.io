                                The Hangar
                                by Daugman 

   This is a DOOM Registered Version PWAD file which replaces Episode 1,
Mission 1.  The scenario is still a Hangar, except this one is tougher.
The level has been completely redesigned using DEU v5.0 and BSP v1.1x.
   To play this Mission, copy HANGAR.WAD into your DOOM directory and type:
DOOM -FILE HANGAR.WAD
   and then start DOOM as usual.  Select Episode 1 and start and you will be
thrown into the thick of things.

   This scenario may be difficult but it *CAN* be finished.  Take your time,
have patience and grab another clip.  Enjoy!
