*** NOTES ***
Here are a few things you should know:

1. To run the game, just type "climb"

2. To change skill levels, type "edit hiclimb.bat", and change the number
after "-skill" to the skill level you want (1-5).

3. Type "hidemo" to see the demo I've included. The demo shows where some of
the secrets are. You should watch this if you need help (or if you need a
BFG9000).

4. There is one button in the game that doesn't make a sound or moves when
you press it (I don't know why), but it does do something. This button is by
a pit of blood and after a Baron. You'll see what I mean when you get there.

5. If you don't like where the Deathmatch starts are, you can change them
for you're own use. I don't know if they're good or not because I can't play
Deathmatch.

6. Please, PLEASE give me feedback about what you think of my level. I would
REALLY appriciate it. Thanks!

Description             : The base of this game is build around stairs (as
                          you know from the title). I have included many 
                          secrets into the game so you have something to
                          search for (besides ammo, life, etc.<g> ). See if
                          you can find them all. Hope you enjoy it!
