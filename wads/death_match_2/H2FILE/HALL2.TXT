Description             : This is another level featuring a large hall.
                          Of course there's lotsa neat stuff to get there.
                          Also, this is the second level I sketched on 
                          paper before building. The first was ying1.wad, 
                          check it out. Built most of the level with DEU2
                          hack for doom2. Furnished it with DCK 2.0 
                          
                          Like my first wad (eyestorm) this one has some
                          extra stuff for deathmatch- secret passages, 
                          teleport, extra weapons and such.

Additional Credits to   : Creators of DEU, DCK, RMB (reject builder). 
                          And, of course, id Software.
