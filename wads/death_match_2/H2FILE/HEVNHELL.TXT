Description             : Literally Heaven and Hell. If you can't figure
                          out which way to go to get to Heaven when you
                          start this level you need help. Heaven is simply
                          a large stockpile of weapons, armor, and health
                          bonuses (Apparently the NRA was right). There are
                          also a few of Hell's more putrid denizens placed
                          in cages for your safety and viewing pleasure, so
                          take the opportunity to waste them. Every type of
                          weapon is available in Heaven except for the BFG
                          (is there one? Go to Hell to find out). Hell is a
                          fairly linear place. In Single Player Mode if you
                          die in Hell you are dead and thats that, but for
                          Multi-Player mode, measures have been taken to
                          ensure that any players that die can re-enter
                          Hell safely many times over. This level isn't
                          meant to be tricky or witty, it is purely kill
                          kill kill kill kill kill jump kill.....

* Construction *
============================================================================

Base                    : New level from scratch
Build Time              : My first level ever, about a week while learning.
Editor(s) used          : DEU 5.0 and BSP 1.0
Known Bugs              : None, at least not fatal ones. It is a very large
                          level, and probably shouldn't be attempted on some
                          slower systems. "Disappearing Things" effects used
                          to occur on this level, until I found out that
                          DOOM really doesn't like too many objects (I had
                          at one point over 900 things, and that was cut in
                          half), but it may still occur occasionally. Also
                          in the corridor with the large skull key doors
                          the game seems to like to inflict damage on you
                          even if you have a radsuit and there aren't any
                          monsters around. This is not a result of paper
                          thin walls, and seems to happen randomly, but
                          it does happen quite often in that particular
                          area. If anyone knows what causes this to happen
                          even when walls are two linedefs thick, please
                          let me know.
