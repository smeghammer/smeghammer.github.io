Misc. Author Info       : After I did the Texas WAD, people started asking me 
                          if I was from Texas. Yes, we live about 20 miles 
                          north of Houston. This WAD was basically designed by 
                          my wife. I did the blue room and the outside area, 
                          with her approval, of course. I added some subtle 
                          little touches to a few of the rooms, also.

Description             : There's no real theme to this WAD file. It's just a 
                          good ole fashioned shoot-em up. I hope you've 
                          practiced killing the Barons of Hell with the chain 
                          gun because you'll have to do that in one spot. Lots 
                          of guys to shoot and lots of places to see. Revised 
                          to support deathmatches.

Editor(s) used          : DoomED-The Real Thing version 2.60
Known Bugs              : There's one. At the beginning there's a nukage 
                          trench. No big deal. There's a radiation suit to 
                          help you make it through. The problem is that 
                          sometimes you'll still lose some health eventhough 
                          you've got the radiation suit on. Makes it 
                          interesting. Don't know why it does this.
