Title                   : HOUSE.WAD

Description             : There are absolutely no creatures to
                          kill in this level.

                          This is a close approximation of
                          my house (location of valuables not
                          included!).  I was surprised how quickly
                          it grew in size.  Alot more could be done
                          if changing the textures was easier.

                          Maybe ID could market DOOM and an editor
                          to realtors with prefab furniture  :>
