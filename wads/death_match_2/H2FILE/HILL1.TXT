Description             : If you played Foothills of Hell for Doom1.666 this 
			  would have been level 4 in that series but DOOM2 
			  came into my life and I had to play with the Super
			  shootgun!  Lots of monsters an just enough bullets. 
			  YES! you will have to find and through ALL the 
			  switches to finish the game!
Additional Credits to   : Greg Smith for play test it!
