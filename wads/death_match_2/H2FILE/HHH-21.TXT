Description		: As usually at that time of the year, Hades was
			  really, really bored.  Aside from the usual job of
			  taking care of the poor dead people, there was not
			  much else he could do -- all of the goddesses
			  were on vacations in far away lands, and Persephone
			  herself was too busy watching the soap operas to
			  even look at him.  And that's when he came up with
			  an idea how to entertain himself -- to build a maze-
			  like house, put one of those unworthy mortals in it,
			  and see if he'll be able to find the way out.  Sadly
			  enough, you happened to be the only person Hades
			  could find before the sunlight started to hurt his
			  eyes.  And thus you have been dragged into the
			  underworld, placed in the House, and the game began.
			  The grand prize is your life.

This is the first part of the "Hades' House of Horrors" series.  Part two,
HHH-22.WAD, is in the making right now.  I'm planning to create a complete 
"Hades'" episode (L1-8).  More on the story as it develops.
