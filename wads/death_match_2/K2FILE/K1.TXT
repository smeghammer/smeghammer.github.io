Well, it's my first level, and it doesn't have a name.

This level is created to replace level E1M1.
To use this level, type doom -file k1.wad.

Unfortunately (for you), when I made this level, I did not kno enough about
making levels to be bothered with implementing the difficulty settings...
so you get a the same number of monsters on any difficulty.  Nightmare is
the only one that will change anything, by making the monsters respawn.

This level is Deathmatch capable, and extra items will be added especially
for a deathmatch (or multiplayer cooperative) game.  There are a lot of 
secret areas in this level, so keep your eyes out for strange looking walls
and the like.  Also, there are multiple teleporters, and you'll learn what
they look like.  (I have found teleportation to be quite an effective mode
of travel)  Also, while playing this level on deathmatch, I discovered a 
neat trick to kill another player or monster.  If you can get a player or
monster to step through a teleporter, follow him/her/it.  If the person/
monster is still standing on the materialization point when you arrive there,
they will be blown to bits... any Monster, and a player with any health will
be instantly blown up... pretty effective to kill your opponent.  Since this
level replaces Episode 1, Map 1, the best weapon you can get is the Rocket
Launcher...   

This level will only run on the registered version of DOOM, since that is
how id wants it.  If you haven't registered DOOM yet, you really should, it's
worth what they're asking for it.  Besides, then you'l be able to create 
your own levels! :)

Well, I guess that's about it... if you have any comments, bug reports,
hate-mail, etc. pertaining to this level, you can send me a message on 
Software Creations.

C ya.

(My next level is in the making, if I can get the nodebuilder to quit 
 breaking...  It will be E1M2, so you (or me, actually) can play this one,
 then when you exit, it will take you to my next level...)
