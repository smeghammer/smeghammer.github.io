Description             : The evil forces have captured a whole small
                          farmer village in a firewall and nobody has the
                          guts to pass the firewall. Your mission is to
                          take you to the village and blow away the evil
                          forces.
                          You are near now but you hear something,
                          you aren't alone in the forest and begin to run
                          to the small castle before something will get you.

                          The game is constructed for a single player on

                          village for some tight fighting.
                          You are supposed to find the amo you need
                          but you must fight to get amo, so if amo
                          is running low begin to run before you run
                          out of it, you need it to pass the enemy.
                          I you leave amo, remember were you left it.

* Construction *

Base                    : New level from scratch
                          (40 hours building + 10 hours playing )
Editor(s) used          : DEU 5.21GCC, BSP 1.2, Reject 1.0
Known Bugs              : In front some of the houses is a small invisible
                          step. It is no playing problem.
                          In two places can monster
                          be invisible from some angles
                          in demo1 it happens once.
                          It has something with nod-building to do.
