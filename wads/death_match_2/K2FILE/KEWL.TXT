                          Yo guyz thiz iz a DeathMatch *ONLY* Wad. And, for 2p-
                          DeathMatching, it's really good. I tried a lot of
                          known excellent deathmatch WADs(the MARKRM series,
                          LEDGES...) and I like this one, too :-)
                          BTW, if you don't know, "kewl" is a way of writing
                          "cool" :-)
