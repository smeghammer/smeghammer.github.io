Description             : Deathmatch Wad for Doom II
                          This wad is the latest version of Kikass.
                          
                          v1.6
                          This introduces a couple of imps, a couple of extra
                          rooms, and a vantage point.

                          v1.1
                          It fixes those bugs, No more teleport in front of
                          the stairs!, and has been improved for deathmatch 
                          play.
