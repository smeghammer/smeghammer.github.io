Description           : Lil' Piggy!  The next installment in my "piggy"
                      : series.  This wad has a similar structure to
                      : piggy.wad yet gets a completely differnet feel to
                      : it as I have added a few ideas to old ones.  Use
                      : this wad in 1-on-1 matches for a really "fair"
                      : match.  I tried to eliminate the "cheating frags"
                      : on this level by taking out hiding places.  There
                      : is of course some piggy trademarks, namely the
                      : "quick stairs", the wood textures, and the BFG
                      : room.  Some of you may dislike the BFG, but it
                      : really kicks ass in 4 player mode.  Free for all 4
                      : player or 2-on-2 teams works extremly well with
                      : this wad.  Hope you enjoy this map, be looking for
                      : the next level in the piggy series, only from me
                      : and waded. :)

Disclaimer            : You have chosen to use this wad.  I'm not forcing you
                      : to in any means.  Whatever the heck happens to your
                      : computer from using this wad is your fault, so don't
                      : come winin' to me.  This wad has been tested in all
                      : modes of play so there should be unexpected problems.
                      : You have been warned.
