Story:   No story, but...  This level can be very enjoyable with 
         monsters and respawn on -- especially with 2 players.
         The two teleporters are strategically placed and can 
         generate quite a few "tele" frags!  This level also makes
         good use of light levels.  There are some dark areas that
         are great for sniping!
