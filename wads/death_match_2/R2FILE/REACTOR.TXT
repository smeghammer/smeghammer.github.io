  Well, here's my first attempt at a Doom patch .wad.  I think
it turned out pretty well.  Reactor.wad was created using Waded
versions 1.17 through 1.23 by Matthew Ayres.  The nodes were built
by BSP version 1.1x. (Sorry, Matt.  Your node builder was still
giving me problems.  You still have the best editor out there, 
though.)  
  All the difficulty levels are active as are cooperative and 
deathmatch multi-player games.  The game might be a bit slow on
Ultra-violent over the modem, though.
  I don't think there are any bugs in this .wad at all.  No HOM
effects or texture alignment problems that I could find.  
  Basically I set it up to look like the Doom dudes had taken over
a nuclear reactor.  I'm particularly proud of the reactor core 
room.
  To play Reactor, unzip all files into doom directory and use 
this command line:

doom -file reactor.wad

then start a new game in episode 1.

  To play the demo of Reactor being beaten on Ultra-violent:

doom -file reactor.wad -playdemo reactor
