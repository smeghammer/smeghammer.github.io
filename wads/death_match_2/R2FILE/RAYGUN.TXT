Title                   : RAYGUN.WAD
Author                  : Brad Bilbo 76050,1437
				

Description             : This is my first WAD.  Designed for single player, 
			  multiple player or Deathmatch modes, easy, medium 
			  or hard. 
			  
			  One of the qualities of DOOM is that it allows 
			  vertical motion.  I tried to take advantage of that 
			  when designing this level.  This is a large WAD, 
			  lots of bad guys, traps and puzzles. This is a 
			  long course. My best times so far are 7:14 min. 
			  with no monsters and about 28 min. at UV.  

Additional Credits to   :  Jim and Brian... for testing and critique
