Title                   : RIP-OFF .99(although the level is called Dimension 42)
                        -affectionately known as rip-off deu to the quantity
                         of things stolen from other pwads-

Instructions for Losers : read the barney story, look at the gif, to install
                          edited Suprwepn patch (added automatic BFG -caution=
                          don't fire the BFG 9000 in the war room on ID) type:
                          dehacked -load kickit.deh
                          Save your doom.exe FIRST.  Then run doom with the
                          -file extension.  If you want the grafix with another
                          patch, use the -file rip-off.wad ??????.wad extension
                          with the "new" level AFTER my patch (so it overwrites
                          my level but not the sprites).

Description             : Well, it's a little bit of everything (as you can/
                          will see).  As far as I know it's the biggest pwad 
                          I've ever seen (if you find something bigger please 
                          tell me, and I'll add something to mine to keep it 
                          number one :).  I've been running it on my 486DX33 
                          and UV has a pretty good speed, but ID (hehehe -see 
                          for yourself) slows down if you leave any monsters 
                          behind (486DX50 recommended for ID).  Reject screws 
                          it up a little... its kinda like every monster has 
                          the "deaf/ambush" bit set, but you get more speed.  
                          
                          With this PWAD you can exterminate the Energizer 
                          Bunny, blast Beavis, blow up Butt-Head, bezerker 
                          punch Barney, cook the charging Cacodemon, and 
                          phscorch the Phsykick (KICK IT! KICK IT! KICK IT!) 
                          Phskull!  That's right, it has sprites (and sounds,
                          and grafx, and a cool level).  You can also kill a
                          Spider Demon with a chainsaw -no worries.  And
                          because the BFG 9000 is so hard to get, I recommend
                          you use the dehacked patch to make ID quasi-fair
                          (or those Cyber Demons might getcha).  Whatever 
                          else would you expect from Dimension 42, the answer 
                          to the universe?  In the final confrontation you 
                          must enter the Barney (read barney.txt) House and 
                          kill Barney and all his clones.  -Good Luck-  That's 
                          the only theme in this PWAD, all else is just chaos.  
                          I hope you like it.
                          
                          I might expand later to make a whole episode, tell
                          me how you like this level.

                          Thank you very much, 49 inch nails.  Goodnight.

                          BTW, if you are playing a coop. game there is a
                          way to kill all players in the game (if they don't
                          have an invuln of course).  Hint:  Close the eye....

                          Sometimes, when you stand right between to sectors,
                          in the center of a linedef, you get this endless

* Hints/Other *

*Look before you leap, but have faith.
*PLAY THIS GAME DEATHMATCH!!!  There are special sectors where you can only get
to in Deathmatch.
*Be very careful with the spiral "staircase", you might get STUCK!
*The beginning is opposite THE END.
*At the top of the pyramid lies Heaven (or was that Hell?)
*Watch out for the fire shooting columns.
*In the Barney room "use" the north side of the column to bring it down.
*Don't turn around or you'll see the sign and that's all that she wants because
you're living in danger playing wheel of fortune.
*ABOVE ALL - DO NOT CLOSE AN EYE!!!!   (They kill -whether that's lights or lives
you'll have to find out >evil grin<)
