Part six of the RAVEN SERIES Map 6

This is part six in the premier Doom 2 RAVEN series.  This .wad will 
challenge all Doom players regardless of skill level.

Features:
- I believe this .wad is the most like a true DOOM .wad
- support for all 5 skill levels
- OK DEATHMATCH level
- well placed monsters
- use of all three keys
- can be completed with out cheating
- excellent texture alignment
- great windows for sniping
- HINT: There is a room near the exit. The door trigger spots
              are under the lights on the ceiling.
             And the dead imps are strategically placed.
 
Use doom2 -file raven6.wad -warp 6    to play.
