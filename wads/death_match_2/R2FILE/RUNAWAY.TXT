Misc. Author Info               : Slightly demented system administrator
                                  who enjoys visualizing certain users and
                                  co-workers being turned into piles of goo.

Description                     : Named not for any particular theme, more for
                                  the fact that once I started designing this
                                  level, I just kind of ran away with sector
                                  creation, and presto....runaway.wad. Has
                                  copious weaponry, but still may be pretty
                                  hard in UV. Not bad for deathmatch, but
                                  kind of spread out. Lots of different textures
                                  lighting and room environments, a few tricks
                                  and secrets and poetic liscence stolen
                                  unabashedly from id's original levels.
