Misc. Author Info       : I enjoy DOOM and DOOM ][ alot! I like
                          to create levels for them as well...
                          Need I say more?

Description             : This was going to be one of those abondoned
                          run down buildings in the middle of nowhere
                          scenarios...but I decided not to do that.
                          This level plays well as a small and challenging
                          single player level and wonderful as a 
                          DeathMatch Level with sniper points and the
                          like. It's still a building in the middle of 
                          nowhere but...lets just say it's owners
                          still live there and enjoy sacrificing to their
                          Gods.
