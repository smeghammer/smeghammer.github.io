Description             : Close quarter melee with that favorite 
                          of weapons, the Shot Gun. Compact,
                          detailed level in the spirit of ID's
                          original first episode. If you're fed
                          up of panoramic blast-o-thon's and
                          "Oh my, there's a Cyberdemon next to
                          the player one start." then this is 
                          for you.
