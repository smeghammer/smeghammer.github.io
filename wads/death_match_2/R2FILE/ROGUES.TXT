Description             : I started this level with a small room and it
                          grew and grew. I always kept in mind that this
                          level should be nice for every skill and for
                          multiplayer also. Especially deathmatch player
                          like it because of its places to shoot somebody
                          from behind and the big duel zone.

Instructions		: just unzip rogues.zip in your doom dir and 
			  type in: doom -file rogues.wad 
			  For further options start README.EXE from id.
