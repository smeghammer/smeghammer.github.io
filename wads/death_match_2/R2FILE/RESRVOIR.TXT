Description             : A reasonably sized Doom 2 level designed for the
                          primary purpose of DeathMatch games.  It's got 
                          plenty of different paths, a few teleporters, and
                          a mix of weapons that don't guarantee a win to
                          any single player.

Additional Credits to   : Jesse Gilles and Jason Statz, for testing.

Additional Notes        : There's a lot of sewage in this level, but I 
                          decided not to make it damaging, since it'd 
                          detract from the fun.  It's mostly just decoration,
                          now.  This is the second Doom level, and first 
                          DeathMatch level I've designed, so tell me what
                          you think, please.

Single Player           : Yes
Cooperative 2-4 Player  : Yes
Deathmatch 2-4 Player   : Yes.  Didn't I just say that?

                    --=How'd THAT happen?=--

Base level              : None.
Build Time              : Not all that long.  Maybe ten hours.  Surprising,
                          since it's much more careful than my last one, 
                          which took much longer.

Editor(s) used          : Waded 1.81
Known Bugs              : A few, very minor. (You'll only notice them if you
                          stand in the exact right position, and face the 
                          exact right direction.)

               --=Fun Copyright/Permission Stuff!=--

If you really want too, go ahead and use this as a base for a different  
level.  Just give me credit for the original, and mention where to get a
copy of Matrix (see below).

You want to distribute this somewhere?  Do, please.  Just make sure this
file is included with it.

      --=What's this fanzine thing I've heard so much about?=--

        A fanzine is kind of like a newsletter, except extremely informal.  
Generally pretty chaotic and entertaining, too.  Mine is Matrix, and it 
focuses mostly and video & computer games.  There's also some stuff on MRPGs,
movies, and such.  To get a copy cheap ($1.00, which only covers printing
and shipping costs), write to:

If you've got comments on the level, send 'em too.
