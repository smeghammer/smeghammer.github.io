Description             : Large radioactive substance processing plant
                          that's been overrun by hell-spawn.  Large, open-
                          plan warehouse section.  Ideal for the Doomer 
                          looking for a bit of a blast.  Also suits co-op
                          netplay (like anyone plays it), but probably a 
                          no-no for deathmatch (I woulda made a dm wad, but...
                          long story).
                          It's a bit linear, but hey, it's only my first
                          wad, so go easy!  You'll have to look real hard
                          to find the super-shotgun without cheating.

Additional Credits to   : iD, of course, and Chrissy M and Tessy F, for a
                          bit of testing.
