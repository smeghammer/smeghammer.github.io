***************    NEW MUSIC FOR DOOM ****************************************

This wad file contians only music, no levels, graphics, sounds etc..


I have changed the music for levels e1m1-4, e2m4 ( one of the original demo 
levels), and the music between levels, and the victory screen(s).  

The last two are the same tunes.  The music for e1m1 and e1m2 is along the same
themes as the original doom music, but the rest, well take a listen and see what
you think!!!


Included with the wad file should be the .mus files for the different tunes.


dm1:


frantic, fast paced techno/speed/metal style.

dm2:

slow, funeral march, scary sounding stuff.

coastgm:

surfs up!!

trackgm:

racetrack music.

happygm:

sickeningly sweet cartoon music.



I will do more, depending on the response and time available.


ENJOY!!

Rick
