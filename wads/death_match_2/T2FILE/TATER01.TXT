Description: 

Pure deathmatch level.  A split-level arena around a small central post 
with linked weapon rooms around the ouside.  Great care went into making 
each major weapon/power up difficult to obtain without a trade-off:

* Shotgun/Chainsaw -- Out in the open.  Not many shells in game so good
     aim and constant restocking are required.
* Super Shotgun -- Located inside the central post on moving floor. 
     Available only 5 seconds or so out of each minute.
* Rocket Launcher -- Located on the second of two adjacent moving-floor
     pillars.  You need to be at the top of one floor while the other
     floor is at its lowest point.  Happens, but takes some effort
     (and a lot of exposing your back).
* Plasma Gun -- Located behind obvious fake wall at top of stairs.  You
     need to shoot into each of the three blinking blue cubby holes
     across the arena to open the necessary doors.
* Chaingun -- Located at the end of a very long, narrow acid hallway.
     Easy to get to, but if anyone with a rocket launcher sees (or hears)
     you go for it you're toast.  Hollow pillars in room make good
     sniping points.
* Blue Armor -- Located at the bottom of a very long lift drop.  Anyone
     who sees you go in there can get into position to blow you away
     by the time you reach the top again.
* Soul Sphere -- Perched atop a pillar with the "lower" switch
     located across the arena.  Two teleporters leading to the pillar 
     and the "hanging garden of dead bodies" next to it lead to ample 
     opportunity for "ball swiping".
* BFG -- doesn't exist.  Never liked that thing in a deathmatch anyway.

Regeneration philosophy -- There are 10 regeneration spots, 8 of 
     which are next to useful items.  This prevents anyone from 
     controlling the level by monopolizing the good weapons.  It's 
     great when a friend kills you in the rocket room to rematerialize 
     next to the rocket launcher, drop to the floor, and kill him before 
     your body even hits the ground (well, not really that fast but you 
     know).

** IMPORTANT ** It is not readily obvious how to get the plasma gun
without reading the above notice.
