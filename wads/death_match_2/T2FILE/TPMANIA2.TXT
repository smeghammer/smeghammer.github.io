Description             : A deathmatch only wad with mostly dark rooms and
			  halls.  Fairly small with very little ammo and few
			  weapons (highest Rocket Launcher).  Once again many
			  teleporters to add some spice.  The teleporters have 
			  a pattern thats not too complicated.  Multiple tp's
			  per tp exit though so don't stand around.
