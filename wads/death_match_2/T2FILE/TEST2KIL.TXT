Description             : Your orders are to infiltrate and destroy 
                          Saten's inner-city training fortress. All
                          of Saten's forces are trained here.

                          As you make your way from the watch tower
                          to each building you will not only encounter
                          some training in progress but might actually 
                          find yourself going through some of Saten's
                          tests.

                          Keep a watchful eye for the exit code.  
                          You need it to exit alive!!

                          Remember that things are not always what they
                          seem and if a situation seems calm then you're
                          in for a big suprise.

                          Lights Off!  Volume Up! and May God be with you!!
