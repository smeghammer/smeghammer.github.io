Description             : Deathmatch only WAD (no monsters) with LOTS of
                          teleporters to spice things up.  Kind of 
                          a wolfenstein flavor in some rooms.  All
                          weapons present and an ammo room for reloading.
                          >Keep moving when you use the teleporters!<
