* Misc. Notes *
This is the Ultimate deathmatch level.  It is designed so that you can
loop around the other player's backside in 3 seconds (on average).
Weapons are scattered evenly throughout the level.  No BFG.

Getting the Plasma Gun will be very difficult if the other guy hears you.
The exit is two-person.  The plasma gun switch must be hit, then the
exit area can be accessed.

I wanted to make a perfect deathmatch level for two or more players.
Too many WADs are too big for two people: this WAD is just right.
