Author Notes            : The author of this wad works in a movie theater, 
                          so getting the chance to wield a shotgun in one
                          of his own design was a form of therapy for him.
                          This is my first level.

Description             : All your buddies have gone to the movies and
                          they've taken all the heavy weaponry with them!
                          This level is designed as your average modern day
                          movie theater, with a few twists.  Run through your
                          local cinema blasting all those annoying patrons
                          in your way, demanding that they decrease the
                          popcorn prices.  Your buddies are in there, dead 
                          or alive.  Can you find them and the weapons they
                          brought with them?  Good luck!

Level notes             : This level is big with lots of stuff.  It will run 
                          slowly on slow computers.  I tried to design it to
                          be difficult, but not impossible, with the theory
                          that lots of killin' is a good thing.

Misc.                   : My original design of this level was much more 
                          complex, but I had trouble rebuilding the nodes
                          when it got too large.  I have only seen one wad
                          file that was larger than this one (significantly)
                          but I don't know how it was done.  If anyone has
                          any info regarding this please let me know.  A
                          PIECE OF ADVICE TO PROSPECTIVE WAD BUILDERS.  You 
                          might want to keep your creative urges in check 
                          enough that you don't make your levels too big, 
                          this one gave me many headaches.

Base                    : New level from scratch
Construction time       : 90 to 100 hours + (I know, I know.  But most of
                          this is the learning curb and accounting for 
                          begginers screwups.)
Editor(s) used          : DEU 5.2
Known Bugs              : I originally made this level much more complex than
                          it currently is, but HOM made me reduce the
                          complexity.  There is a slight and distant HOM in
                          certain parts of the lobby, and in the large theatre,
                          but overall it isn't unbearable.
