Misc. Author Info       : An avid Doomer since 12/10/93 (The Day),
                          now working with a 386/40, unfortunately.
                          Likely my last WAD, at least for the time
                          being.  Nothing like going out with a
                          bang!

Description             : Night falls as you prepare to enter another 
                          base on Phobos.  This base was built right 
                          into the hills, and uses a lot of natural 
                          caverns in it's design.  Three levels of 
                          great fun and interesting designs.  These 
                          levels are best for non-deathmatch play, 
                          although deathmatch starts are there.  They 
                          should also have very little slowdown, 
                          since I designed them with a 386/40.
                 Level 1: This level is pretty difficult, with little 
                          ammo or health, and monsters from all sorts 
                          of triggered doors.  Also, heavy on the 
                          triggers and switches.  (My specialty!  :')
                          Cool places include an expansive cavern and
                          a couple "pseudo-mazes".  
                 Level 2: This level is an exhibition of really cool 
                          designs, including a number of places with 
                          manual light-sourcing, and every other 
                          neat thing I could think of.  Visually
                          entertaining, fun to play.
                 Level 3: Well, this one is just cool.  Hard, fun, 
                          some caverns, a bunch outdoors.  If you
                          can't find all the secrets... have you 
                          gone through every teleporter?  A nice 
                          stressful conclusion to the trilogy.

                          If you get stuck on a level, or are trying
                          to find some of the secrets, watch the 
                          demos.  They cover most of the good stuff, 
                          and show the way through the level.

                          (wait for Doom 1.4!).  A place with a 
                          teeny bit of HOM, due to 128+ linedefs, 
                          in level 3 (I even took some good stuff

                          would've been a little bigger, except BSP
