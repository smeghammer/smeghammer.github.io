Description	       : This is an ONLY Deathmatch Wad cause there are no
			 monsters in it. You can still play it standalone
			 if you enjoy it.
			 This is not the first WAD I made but i decided to
			 make a simple level, like MAP01 cause it seems it
			 is the most enjoyable when it is small. It was
			 specially intended for carnage doom.
			 Please send me a mail to give me your impressions
			 or comments.
