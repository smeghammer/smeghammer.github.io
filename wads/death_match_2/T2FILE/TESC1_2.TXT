Here it is!  The first compleate wad based on The Evergreen State College's 
campus.  It's twice the size of the original release and a lot more detailed.  
It also has fully implemented difficulty levels and network play 
capabilities.  I know a lot of the texture, especially doors, are not quite 
right but I don't really feel like spending the several hours it would take 
to tweak them around.  This level is made for e2l1 and is based on our 
library building.  In case you are familure with the campus the level is 
meant to travel from the first floor to the basement and then up to the 
second floor.  Any comments or suggestions would be greatly apreciated.  
I ran this through bsp so none of the bugs in the first release should be 
in there now.  Thanks to all the people who e-mailed me on how to fix this, 
and once again thanks to the creators of deu and bsp.  This is my first 
compleate wad and I would really like some feedback.  I can be reached at 
newmanb@elwha.evergree.edu.  Thanks for playing tesc_2.wad and happy dooming!
