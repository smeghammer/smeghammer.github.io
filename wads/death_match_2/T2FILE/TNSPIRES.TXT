TNSPIRES - A DEATHMATCH LEVEL (E2M1) BY VALIS

Here's another one, based on a friend's suggestion.  You want simple and
devilish, you get simple and devilish. :-)  This one is designed for hours
of pointless fragging.  If you ever wanted to be REALLY HIGH UP in Doom,
here is your chance!  (If you fall, stick around.)

Another fine DEU 5.0/BSP 1.0 by-product, as usual.
