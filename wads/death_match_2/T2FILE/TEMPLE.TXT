Description             : You are entering the big temple of DOOM.
                          I have build a big temple room, and... other
                          rooms to buils a DOOm level.
                          I've tested it in 'Heart Me Plenty' diff. setting,
                          but I know where are the monsters... so it's 
                          difficult to see if the difficulty levels are
                          correctly set. If not, I think the y are more
                          difficult than the ID ones.
                          I can't play via net, so I can't make a multi-player
                          game. I have just put 4 deathmatch starts and 4 
                          players starts, but I can't say if TEMPLE.WAD is
                          a good multi-player level. I hope someone will try
                          and tell me what to do to change it in a GREAT 
                          net game.

                          Please, test it and tell me if you liked it or not.
                          I will end it (some little think to add...) and
                          build one new, and would like to know where I did
                          the good thinks and where I made some mistakes...
               
                          Thanx. (and excuse me for my bad english...)
