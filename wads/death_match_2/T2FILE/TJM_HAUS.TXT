                          We pay $2600/mo. to live in this sh*thole.

Description             : Well, this is the house I've been living
                          in for the past year or so, replete with
                          secret passages and stuff that isn't honestly
                          there (with the notable exception of the dead
                          bodies in the basement, which we have to assume
                          are there since that door is locked from the
                          inside).  Each room has many exits, and there
                          is a good mix of small rooms and wide-open
                          spaces. Try it with -warp 01 -respawn for
                          variety; just enough shotgun dudes to keep it
                          interesting.

Brief Description:        House, encircled w/yard/ledge, w/staircase
                          teleports to basement.  Check out the twilight
                          zone door-to-"nowhere" on the ledge!
