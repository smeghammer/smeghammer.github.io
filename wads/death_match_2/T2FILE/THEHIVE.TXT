Misc. Author Info       : Thanks go to Alex Wayne for play 
                          testing and some very good ideas
                          

Description             : They're back. This time it's not the 
                          moons they are after, but Mars itself.
                          There is a hive/colony on the surface,
                          and you (lucky you!) have been chosen
                          to lead the attack. But your company
                          never made it down, and you are the 
                          only one left. You have some 
                          explaining to do.

                          Assuming, of course, that you can make 
                          it back.

			  This is the first four levels. I hope to have
			  the rest of them done soon. As I finish them,
			  they will show up at the ftp site on infant2

			  If you are the hack-n-slash type, you won't make
			  it very far in these levels. Most of them require
			  some thought, and a LOT of F6. However, I have made
			  it through on Ultra-Violence to the end of Level
			  4, so it CAN be done. Good luck!
