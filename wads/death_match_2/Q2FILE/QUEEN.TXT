Title                   : Queen of the DoomWeb
                           a Study in Plasma

Description             : As you stride down to the burning city of
                          Hell On Earth you note a baron reading a
                          sign.  The baron appears rather annoyed at
                          the weathered sign reading "Under 
                          Construction - please come back in October."
                          The baron gives one final scream and heads
                          for a rock outcropping.  You follow - and
                          find yourself teleported along with the baron
                          back to his queen's layer (nix your armor
                          and all weapons but your pistol)!

Additional Credits to   : All those folks out there who've volunteered
                          their time to make Doom a better game.  A
                          special thanks also to my brother for letting
                          me use his 486/50 to make this thing.  Doom
                          doesn't run so good on my old Atari ST or
                          286/12. <g>

* Play Information *

Episode and Level #     : E2M1, E2M2
Single Player           : Yes
Cooperative 2-4 Player  : Yes (but untested)
Deathmatch 2-4 Player   : Yes (but untested)
Difficulty Settings     : Medium and Hard only.  You try the wimpy
                          levels and you get jumped by two barons.
                          The medium and hard levels are pretty
                          different, so you'll want to play both.
                          Medium first, then hard.
New Sounds              : No
New Graphics            : No
New Music               : No
Demos Replaced          : Two LMPs are provided with the level.  With
                          Doom 1.666 coming so soon I didn't want to
                          put an out-of-date demo right in the WAD, so
                          I just zipped it in the archive.  The film's
                          name is HMPxx.LMP (recorded at difficulty level
                          'hurt me plenty').  It contains some spoilers
                          but leave's plenty to be discovered.  HMP12 is
                          set up for version 1.2 and HMP16 is for Doom
                          version 1.6.

* Construction *

Base                    : New level from scratch
Editor(s) used          : DEU 5.21gcc, BSP11x
Known Bugs              : Some of the outer hex's textures don't line
                          up so well but still look decent.  There's 
                          one room where you have to jump to a 
                          teleporter that sometimes doesn't work.
                          (Had to take two runs at it in the 
                          1.2 demo, for instance.)

This level could still take some more work, but school's starting and 
my brother will be taking his computer away, leaving me with the 1985 
technology again.  Anyone wanting to add things to the level, go 
right ahead.  I was hoping to use the 'easy' modes to make more of a 
shoot'm'up level (lots of monsters, lots of ammo/health), for instance.
Maybe even replace the plasma guns with BFGs and have the players go 
through the level using just BFG or pistol.  A lot of the rooms could
use decorations and lighting as well.


If anyone wants to include this in a wadpak, please make the first 
level of this wad the first level in one of the episodes.  It's 
designed for plasma-only and thus would be substantially less fun if 
the player(s) came in loaded with shotgun shells and such.
