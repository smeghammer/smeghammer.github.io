Description             : Every College campus has a "Quad". It's a  
			  central place where people go to relax, read,
			  you know... Don't think youre gonna' get much
			  relaxation in THIS quad, though. It IS a central
			  place, but it only leads to HELL... 

Notes                   : As stated in the Library description, a 486DX or                          
			  better is highly recommended to avoid slow play
			  in places. DOOM Registered version 1.4 or higher 
			  is REQUIRED to be able to save in UltraViolence at 
			  the beginning. Using 1.4+ will also eliminate HOMs
			  in some areas due to > 128 lines in view.


Additional Credits to   : Jim F. Flynn and John Keary for playtesting, Jim
			  especially for many good ideas.
			: Matt Tag. for DOOMCAD
			: Colin Reed for BSP 1.2x
			: id Software, for DOOM !
