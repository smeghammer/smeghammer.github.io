DESCRIPTION         : Your squad is to beam down to the surface and 
                      investigate the sudden loss of communication lines 
                      between UAC and a remote command center on the moon
                      Deimos, Enemy activity is suspected. Your squad will eliminate 
                      any enemy activity with extreme predjudice.
                      Unfortunately, detailed surface maps are unavailble
                      due to the sensitive nature of company operations.
HINT                : Precision marksmanship and careful movement will
                       reduce casualties.
