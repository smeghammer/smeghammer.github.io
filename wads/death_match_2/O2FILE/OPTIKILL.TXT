* Copyright / Permissions *
You can distribute this WAD freely, but credit where credit is
due. If you modify it, please e-mail me a copy with a short list
of changes made so I can see what was done to make it better.
If you use this as part of a compilation on a CD-ROM, I would
appreciate a free copy.


* Play Information *
Definitely best with four players due to the fact that it ain't
linear and it can be a while before you meet your enemy.
Watch that Cyber!
I made sure that this was not another level overloaded with monsters
and weapons.  Both are used sparsly and positioned in places where
where they make best impact on playability.

Please mail me with criticism or commendation 'cause I am nearly
finished another Deathmatch WAD and if you want I'll send it to 
you for playtesting before I upload it anywhere.

			Go get DOOMin.....

Get It From:

FTP.CDROM.COM
or
alt.binaries.doom (newsgroup)  if I bother to put it there.

PS. If your PC is directly connected to the net I'd love to
    organise a deathmatch with you.
    We are on the lookout for other worthy Doomers because 
    the same old guys do get boring.
