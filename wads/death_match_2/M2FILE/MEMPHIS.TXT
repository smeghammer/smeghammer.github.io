Description             : Having just discovered the secret entrance to
                          the long lost unholy temple of Memphis you must
                          proceed to infiltrate and destroy the remaining
                          unholy hosts, then escape with your life. The 
                          authors recommend playing ultra violence, unless
                          yer a fucking lame ass. There aren't any really
                          big monsters because karl hates them, but be 
                          careful with your supplies anyway, because there
                          ain't no such thing as a free lunch.
