================================================================

Welcome to my first WAD.  It was a lot of fun creating it.  I hope
you have as much fun playing it.  My beta-testers had a lot of good
things to say about it.   One thing they warned me about: don't try this
level using only keyboard control if you usually play DOOM with a mouse.
Words to live by.

Perhaps this really isn't an E1M1, but if you're loading in
new WADs it probly doesn't matter where you put this level.

Comments appreciated.  Good luck!
