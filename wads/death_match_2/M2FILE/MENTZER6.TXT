Description             : AKA: Frag Count

			 Number 6 in the Mentzer series.
			 The small size of this wad will run up the frag
			 count.  The action centers around the BFG room
			 which has four ways into it, and only one way out.
			 All weapons are included.

			 After playing this wad you will know DEATH.  I hope
			 you know it from the right side.
