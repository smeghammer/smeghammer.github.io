Misc. Author Info       : This is my first full WAD, more to follow

Description             : A Marine Base on a distant outpost, taken
			over by the Hordes of Hell.
			
			  Although saved as E1M1, it is probably a 
			better replacement for E1M4 or E2M2.
			  It includes an exit to the secret level, 
			but it's tough to find.
			  The regular exit takes a bit of fancy finger-
			work to get to as well!
			
			  Only contains Weapons 1-5, but adds a Plasma 
			gun (and no extra cells) in Deathmatch mode.
			
			  I've tried to keep all textures etc. pretty 
			consistent, except for a few special areas, 
			and I think I've gotten rid of all HOM effects. 8-)
			  The only construction problem that I can find is 
			in the deep blue Demon room (you'll know it when 
			you get there), that sometimes the screen gets 
			stuck in 'Cyberspace' 8-( - any hints on how to fix 
			this gratefully received. Other than that, all 
			walls have been aligned unless they 
			(a) hide secret doors, or 
			(b) are meant to be that way (cf the spiral staircase)
			
			  This is probably a little easy as is, but I'm 
			going to add more monsters for UV, and take away 
			a few imps and sergeants for ITYTD

			  As this is my first level, I'd be really pleased
			to get some feedback, especially from Watcher (there's 
			only one small maze 8-)) and Cameron Newham - you guys 
			write the best damned reviews I've EVER read! - even if 
			I don't always agree with you.

			  So, Play and Have Fun, but most of all, Do it to them, 
			before they do it to you...

Additional Credits to   : Brendon Wyber and Rapha‰l Quinet for DEU, 
			the BEST Doom Editor around
			  Jason Hill, for the sick maze clues that no-one will 
			ever find or understand
			  Anyone who playtests it
			  and, of course, id Software, without whom my flat 
			would be decorated by now!
