* Where to get this WAD *

FTP sites: infant2.sphs.indiana.edu
           and all mirror-sites of course

Other: 
To use M_Sprite.wad one needs to use dmadds to include rest of the 
sprites to play the game. If you prefer walk-through, just run:

doom -file m_sprite.wad m_rohe.wad

and there are no guns to spoil the harmony of this famous site. And that
statue is there, where it should be.

But to have a good game, read instructions of dmadds (ftp it from infant2)
and use m_sprite.wad to create "complete".wad of sprites. 
There is lot to shoot ... Have fun.

I will also release (later this year, 1994) Stimpy.wad (as an honor to
Ren & Stimpy cartoon characters). It is sprite only replacement wad!!!

That's all folks. Jussi.
