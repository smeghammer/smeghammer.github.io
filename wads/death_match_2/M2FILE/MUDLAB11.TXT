******************* THE INFILTRATOR ******************

Level One: MUDLAB11.WAD - E1L1  -  Headquarters.
You have successfully infiltrated the enemies labratory base 
but..  while you were "freshening up", they have discovered 
your true identity!  Now you're stuck smack dab in the middle 
of them with only the weapons that you always carry... and 
whatever else you can scavange.  The only way out is through
the lower levels.  

Level Two: MUDRAT12.WAD - E1L2  -  Deeper Into The Complex.
Now ya did it, Does the term "outa the frying pan and into the
fire" mean anything?  These guys are relentless.  Goal here is
to get out.  You're gonna hafta just search around for the door 
to the key.  Save Your Game! 

Level Three: MUDVAT13.WAD - E1L3  -  Lower Levels
Got to this floor, now all the doors are locked, better go 
somewhere and get a way in.  Funny how sometimes the only way 
out is to go deeper. Good Luck!   

Levels Four thru Nine are on the table - Soon Now!

**************************************************************
			
MISC. INFO - HOW TO AND SUCH.....

TO PLAY EXTERNAL WAD FILESM  
Copy the WAD files into your Doom directory and then type    

DOOM -FILE MUDLAB11.WAD MUDRAT12.WAD MUDVAT13.WAD
  
This will load the WADs and start the game at Episode 1 - Level 1.
You may need to warp (IDCLEV and 1-3 for Episode and 1-9 for
the Level) to go to any other level immediately.

There are several real good menuing systems, or Wad Managers as it 
were. These will all load multiple wads in their latest versions.
"Doom Master" is one that will load any PWAD, or Patch Wad in 
your Doom dir and allows for all utilities to be accessed through it 
directly.  "WadGod" is another that will let you do this but only with 
Zipped Wads, and from any directory.  "Doom Launcher" is a Windows 
version that provides all the PIF information that you'll need, but 
the sound fx don't work quite right on mine.  As I write my Wads in 
Windows with "DoomEd, The Real Thing" I use this to test areas and 
stages of development.  Each of these are best for various reasons.
Please don't forget to register shareware that you find useful.  

Thats all for now.  Please send any comments you may deem suitable.  
I've certainly enjoyed seeing other folks' work on line and hope to see 
lots more.  Gotta fill the new 540 D drive you know.  Thanks go to the 
folks at id who bear absolutely no responsibility for the way this file 
behaves, and as I have no control over your machines configuration, neither 
do I.  Sorry, had to say that, I guess.

What's with Mud, you may ask.  And well you may.  I am Pres of The West Mountain 
Mudbrothers Mountainbiking Club and as such the word (and substance) have a great 
deal of significance in everyday life.  

iddqd - god
