Description             : Two classic Doom levels complete with
                          all three keys, traps, secret doors,
                          and of course, lots of targets.  These
                          levels are an attempt to mirror the
                          mood and detailed maps that made the
                          original game so much fun.  Stress 
                          was placed on QUALITY.  Some WAD
                          files floating around have a thrown
                          together feel.

                          For those veterans of MAKDOOM1, I have
                          attempted to create a different
                          "flavor" with the second level...A new
                          style rather than a rerun of the same
                          traps, etc.  You be the judge.

                          This should only be used with the 
                          registered version of Doom as it
                          replaces the second episode.
                          
                          Please E-mail me if you have the time
                          and let me know what you think....
                          If you like it, I'll make more.  ;^)

                          The authors of the editors mentioned
                          below, they are all great programs...

                          The Beta testers who put up with MANY
                          stupid bugs, any that remain are my
                          oversight, not theirs...

                          e-mailed or written me with comments
                          and suggestions, you have "kept the
                          barrel warm" and enabled the
                          completion of a second twisted level...
