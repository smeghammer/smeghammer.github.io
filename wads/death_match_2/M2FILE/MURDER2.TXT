                          A spelunker's horror story

         This WAD is for registered versions of DOOM by id Software.

   For solo cave explorers this level is not overdone in difficulty.  There
is only one Baron and two cacodemons, nothing harder.  Difficulty levels have
been set as well as four multi-player start positions and nine deathmatch
reincarnation spots.  For deathmatch players, extra weapons have been placed.  
Sorry, no BFG.  
   There are numerous sniper spots and hide-aways for those not inclined to
roam about.  Almost all parts of the cave are accessible by teleport.  This
was to preclude lots of passage hunting.
   Two keyed cave gates let the solo player explore all the passages before
arriving at the exit (beyond Double Wells). 
   A self-running DEMO is included.  Simply type MURDERME to watch it.  
Select Episode two to play it. This level replaces E2M1.

   For those interested in reading it, the following paragraphs describe the
REAL Murder Hole cave that this level was modeled after.

   Murder Hole is a vertical cave (ropes required) and very dangerous due to
shifting breakdown, numerous pits, and exposure (amount of empty space below
you on various straddles and climbs).  Some friends and I are currently
surveying the cave and it should top out around two miles in length.
   The entrance is a 78 foot rappel that leads to two Straddle Pits.  The 
third pit drops into the Climbing Section.  The next room is the Meander Room 
(demon lunching on a cave vandal).  This central room has passages to the west 
and to the east.  
   The western side leads to the Park Bench overlooking a chasm, then to the
pool area (protective Baron).  Beyond, the Layback Climb leads up to a large
room that may be a second entrance (lava room).
   Eastward from the Meander Room, a staircase leads up to a passage with the 
Elevator on the left and the Butt Ledge ahead (we normally sit on the ledge
with feet dangling over the 30 foot pit and lean under the overhanging rock)!
Beyond the Butt Ledge is Double Wells; twin 90 foot pits.   
   The three northern passages seen on the map from this area all lead down
to the Elevator stream which we have now connected to the Climbing Section 
(yellow key gate). The western side of this stream sumps north in a round 
room. This is the entrance to Atlantis.  We surveyed through it during a long 
drought and connected it back to the chasm area. Unfortunately, since Atlantis 
is underwater most of the year, so it is here.  
   Many passages have been left out due to editor restrictions.  Still, you
are looking at over a mile of cave!

      Remember the caving motto;

      Take nothing but pictures,
      Leave nothing but footprints,
      Kill nothing but time.

               Yeah, right!!

Enjoy!
