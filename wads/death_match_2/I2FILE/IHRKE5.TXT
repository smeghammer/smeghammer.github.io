Description             : This PWAD is for E1M1.  It was designed for
	                  deathmatch, which is only way to play DOOM!!

Additional Notes        : There are three secret areas on this level,
			  one has a plasma gun (which is the most
			  powerful weapon you will find on this level).
		          The other two are good places for snipers.
			  None of these areas are on the map

                          Please send me any comments or suggestions for 
                          improvement.
