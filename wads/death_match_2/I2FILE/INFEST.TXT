Author                  : Nicholas Bell
Email Address           : CIS 72162,1667
Misc. Author Info       : Previous DOOM levels: "Pits" (DMPITS.ZIP) and
                          "Portal" (DMPRTL.ZIP)
                          Aces Over Europe - AOEREAL.ZIP, AOEFIX.ZIP,
                          AOEFLT.ZIP, etc. Aces over the Pacific - APFMD.ZIP, 
                          APDMG.ZIP, etc.

Description             : You've gone into the pest control business by 
                          yourself, and the critters at this place are coming 
                          out of the walls!  The owners don't seem too pleased
                          about your activities - who called you in anyway?

                          You START at the exit door. Remember where it is!
                          There are NO dead-end traps, but things can get 
                          hairy, so save often.  There are many choices to
                          be made in this level, so once you finish the level
                          try it again using a different approach. It plays
                          differently everytime for me.  And don't cheat!

* Play Information *

Episode and Level #     : E1M4 (background music fits well)
Start-up Instructions   : If you're not using a front-end batch file creator,
                          while in your DOOM directory, type: 
                          doom -devparm -warp 1 4 -file infest.wad -skill #
                          (# = 1 thru 4: 1 easiest, 4 "Ultraviolence" the 
                          recommended skill level:)
Single Player           : Yes
Cooperative 2-4 Player  : Yes
Deathmatch 2-4 Player   : No (sorry, it just doesn't work given the layout and
                          object placement)
Difficulty Settings     : Yes, however the level was designed at Ultra-
                          Violence and may seem somewhat bland at easier 
                          levels. (in fact, it's down right boring at 
                          anything other than Ultra-Violence!) Difficulty 
                          settings include changes in quantity and type 
                          of objects and monsters.
New Sounds              : No
New Graphics            : No
Demos Replaced          : None

* Construction *

Base                    : New level from scratch.
Build Time              : 40 hours. DEU 5.1 cut my time in half. 
Editor(s) used          : DEU 5.1, BSP 1.1x
Known Bugs              : A few minor texture offsets which refuse to realign.
                          Frame rate drops in one certain large room. This is
                          after I eliminated many linedefs which made the room
                          much more interesting, but killed the frame rate 
                          even more.

General Hints & Suggestions
-It isn't always necessary to kill a monster as soon as you meet it. If you
 can get by it, wait until you are properly armed. Sometimes running away is
 the best tactic.                       
-Recon by fire is an effective tactic in dark passages, if you have the ammo.
-Wall textures are important.
-Going for the goods immediately isn't always a good idea. Always clear your
 escape route, and try and remember where it is.
-Whenever possible, give the monsters a "crushing headache."
-ALWAYS expect surprises, even in "cleared" areas.
-Try a different route next time.
-Use the exit door in the beginning! <g>
