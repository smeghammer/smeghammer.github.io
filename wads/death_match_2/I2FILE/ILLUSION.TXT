Description             : Deep in the heart of the Phobos Moon Base,
                          you find a strange teleport pad.  With 
                          demons and spectres hot on your tail, your
                          only hope is this strange device.  Stepping
                          onto it, you find yourself in a strange new
                          place.  Things are not as they seem here - 
                          an innocent wall may hide hell-spawn, or a
                          new weapon.  Always watch your back....

Things you WILL find in this WAD:
=================================
Plenty of enemies, plenty of ammo, plenty to do.  Large changes to the
level throughout the course of play.  Plenty of traps.  At least one of
each weapon (in Ultra Violence - in lower levels, the more powerful weapons
are not available in single player mode).  It IS possible to get the BFG
without cheating, but it's not easy!

Things you WON'T find in this WAD:
==================================
Large dark areas (I hate those), inescapable traps, "unavoidable damage"
(ie damaging floor etc, that you HAVE to go through).

Challenge:
==========
Get the BFG9000 WITHOUT cheating!

Miscellaneous:
==============
PLEASE do not use cheats with this level!  I spent over 50 hours working
on it (it's my first), and I put a lot of thought into such things as the
BFG "happy room", the crusher etc. 
This level is not meant to be supremely difficult, but it should prove
challenging even to experienced players on Ultra Violence.
NOTE:  It is possible to make most of the major fights easier by using the
surrounding area to your advantage - look for switches, power - ups etc!
This level is mostly non-linear - most parts can be completed in several
different orders, although some keycards are necessary, but you will find
it much easier if you do them in a particular order.
HINT:  Go right at the start first!
