Background              :

You pull back on the throttle and begin your decent.  Below, the Io
military special projects base appears peaceful.  You know otherwise.
High Command lost contact with the secret outpost several weeks ago and
dispatched the spacecruiser STALWART to investigate.  Failing to
establish direct-contact communications, it has become your duty to
journey down to Io and assess the situation.

During your mission briefing, High Command revealed some disturbing
information to you concerning problems with the now defunct UAC bases on
Mars.  H.C. gave no details, mentioning a highly classified project that
"didn't quite work out as expected".  All they would say is that you
should exercise extreme caution when approaching Io, as similiar
research was in progress there.

As you thumb the retro-thrusters on, you notice a lot of commotion near
the landing pad.  You breathe a sigh of relief, glad that at least
everyone appears to be all right.  Their transmitter is probably down.
You reach for the com link to radio STALWART to send down a tech team . . .

Your shuttlecraft lurches violently.  You drop the com link and grab the
controls, trying in vain to bring the craft back in line.  No use -
you've lost engine control.  Your ship is all ablaze.  You focus all of
your strength and concentration, willing your ship to crash/land near
the landing pad, where help will be quickly available.  With a
ear-splitting cacophany of tearing metal, your shuttle comes to a rest.
You fight to maintain consciousness, moving through the flames and smoke
toward the hatch.  It opens up, letting in the feeble light of a sun
hundreds of millions of miles away. You stumble through.  Coughing
violently, you look up and see . . .

"WHAT IN THE HELL . . .?!"

You fall unconscious.

You awake, only to find yourself alone in a gloomy prison cell.  From
the looks of the decaying bodies around you, the chances of rescue look
slim. However, you didn't get into special forces by depending on others
to solve your problems.  A few minutes later when a guard walks by your
cell, you reach out and grab the poor fool, instantly breaking his neck.
You take his pistol, and begin your fight to freedom . . .

Mission Seques
Mission 2         : You've managed to escape imprisonment, only to
                    discover that the Io base has been completely
                    overrun by the enemy.  And where are the thousands
                    of personnel who were stationed here?

Mission 3         : You've routed the enemy, and they've retreated into
                    the underground waste disposal system. However, you
                    can find no trace, dead or otherwise, of the men and
                    women who were stationed on Io.  Alone, and without
                    transport or communications, you're only chance to
                    make it off this rock anytime soon is to give chase
                    to the demons, in hopes of locating the missing Io
                    personnel.

Mission 4         : You've battled it out with the forces of evil down
                    in the treacherous waste disposal system beneath the
                    Io base, and kicked their collective asses.  But
                    you've only won a small victory - and the bad guys
                    are looking to even the score.  As you walk through
                    the pressure door and emerge from the sewers, you
                    find yourself in a large underground cavern.
                    Exhausted and wounded, you gather your courage and
                    determination and prepare to face your toughest
                    challenge yet.  If you are to have any hope of
                    surviving this ordeal, you must take the greatest
                    leap of your life - and plunge into THE ABYSS.


Additional Credits to   : Chris Peters, without whom I would have no
                          computer to waste my time building missions
                          for DOOM!, and whose advice was of great help.
                          Also, for helping find the bugs (see below).

                          Scott A. Smith, who (I discovered a few weeks
                          after writing the first mission) originally
                          came up with the idea of "imprisonment" and
                          reaching through bars to kill guards in his
                          highly commendable e1m1sas.wad, available at
                          infant2.  Kudos to Scott.

                          But seriously:
                          One HOM in mission 1

                          Many, many bad wall textures in mission 4, due
                          to oversized sectors.  However, most of these
                          are concealed by the fact that you can't reach
                          the walls.  They are surrounded by a river of
                          lava, and to keep people from killing
                          themselves in long, treacherous falls into the
                          lava, I have inserted several impassable lines
                          (conveniently, these lines also conceal 99% of
                          the bad walls).  There are still bad walls (I
                          believe the effect has been dubbed the "veil"
                          effect), and only one or two HOM's.  Overall,
                          I do not think it affects play much.  But, if
                          you are one of those types who can't stand
                          HOM's or bad walls, then I advise not playing
                          this wad.
