           The DOOM .LMP Film Collection: Collector's Edition

Title      :  I thought this was impossible

Skill      :  Ultra Violent

Summary:

This was originally intended to be a 30 second test to see if ALFRED's new
PWAD record feature worked, but as with most of my tests I just kept on 
playing to see how far I could go. It turned out I went further than I 
thought...

I don't know who created the pwad file for this .LMP (let me know), but 
thanks for the exciting level!
