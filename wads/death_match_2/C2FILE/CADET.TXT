Description             : So you finally get to go to cadet school.
Your mum drops you off at the main gate. As she pulls away you look
to see her laugh and slowly her face changes to that of a green 
skinned Demon. Suddenly you put together the mornings events into one
great illusion. You have been duped. It seems you are to be the next meal 
at the Demons cadet school. The gate is already closed, too late to turn and
run. The only way out is to battle your way through the demons own training
ground to safety !!! ?.

This level can get tough if you go to fast, slow down take on one task at a
time and search for the appropriate weapons.
