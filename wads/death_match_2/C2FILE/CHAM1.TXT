Description             : Drew most of this one out on paper. 
                          One room has four different looks, at each phase 
                          of the level it will change. Depending on what 
                          secrets you find, the ending can play quite 
                          differently. My first DCK level.

Additional Notes        : This level has a few nasty traps, save often. Look
                          to the demo (cham1.lmp) for general play. (Not all
                          secrets are shown.) Still once you know, it can be 
                          done without saving. Skill 3 has fewer monsters 
                          and the same ammo and health, if you want just a 
                          taste. Also the new textures I made add spice to 
                          one area. Please send any comments, criticism.

                          Plus a Deathmatcher or two.
