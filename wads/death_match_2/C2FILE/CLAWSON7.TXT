Additional Credits to   : This PWAD was named for a good friend of mine
                          whose father just passed away after a struggle
                          with Lou Gehrig's disease. Rest assured that
                          your dad will not be forgotten, Scott. I would
                          also like to dedicate this PWAD to my girlfriend
                          who, altho she hates DOOM with a passion, still
                          admits thats she's proud of the PWADS I've made.
                          Thanks to Rich Condon for testing the level.
                          More credits given later...

Description             : Plot? Who needs a plot? Ummm, you're dropped in
                          the crater of a dead volcano and someone just
                          happened to leave weapons and shit all over the
                          place. Maybe you're in some futuristic combat
                          training facility. Perhaps a religious cult was
                          living in a secluded mountain and built all of
                          this but then suddenly decided to mass suicide.
                          Who cares?

Points of Interest      : Invisible Walkway:

                             This took a while to figure out, altho I'm
                             sure someone else has done something similar
                             before this. Yeah that's why there are those
                             two lines of seemingly useless light pillars,
                             people were bitching about running into the
                             invisible walls.

                          Guard/Sniper Tower:

                             Ok, I readily admit that I blatantly stole
                             the proximity detectors from the guy who did
                             Aliens-TC (I think it was him.. was it?). The
                             alarms outside of the tower indicate that
                             there is someone in the tower, and are reset
                             if the player in the tower leaves by either
                             jumping out the front or taking the teleport.
                             The alarms inside the tower tell whoever may
                             be inside that someone else is poking around
                             outside, so stay on your toes. (You can reset
                             the inner alarms by going into the cubicle
                             marked "Proximity Retrigger", so if the person
                             is stupid and comes inside and you kill them
                             you can be ready for the next dumbass that
                             wanders along).

                          Cooperative Exit:

                             Standard Deal. Inside the Green Rock Building
                             is a switch one the wall. Hit that switch to
                             lower Lift A, which takes you to another one
                             that lowers Lift B, which takes to yet another
                             switch which lowers the wall behind the first
                             switch, thus exposing the pulsing exit switch.
                             Confused? Good. Suffice to say you need two
                             players to accomplish this.
