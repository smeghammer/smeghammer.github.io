Description             : You find yourself in a dark cave facing 
                          a large castle.  Don't stare too long, 
                          though, or you will die.  
                          
                          Once inside the castle, you must fight 
                          your way from room to room and find the 
                          switches that will let you escape.

                          
                          This is the second level I have done, 
                          but the first was rather basic.  This
                          level was designed mainly for a
                          single player.  I have not tried this 
                          level in cooperative or deathmatch 
                          modes, but it should work.
