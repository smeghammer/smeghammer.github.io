Description             : This wad takes you through all aspects
                          of DOOM.  It contains most of the 
                          weapons, and almost all of the monsters.  
                          It is has a lot of different types of 
                          rooms, textures, and settings.  For my 
                          first wad, I combined a lot of the 
                          ideas that I had. Please e-mail me and
                          tell me what you think.
