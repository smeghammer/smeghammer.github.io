Description             : This is a first time try at building a level from
                          scratch. It was mainly built for deathmatch play but
                          found that it is great for a 1 player game. The name
                          is "CAREFUL" for a very good reason. There are alot
                          of secret passages, so keep hunting - all is not what
                          it seems. ;-)  Please let me know if there are any
                          problems encountered. See ya on the other side.
