Description             : A nasty little Deathmatch WAD.  For Deathmatch
                          only.  Simple, yet elegant.  Sleek, yet intricate.
                          Simple, yet deadly.  Sweet, yet sour.. (oh wait)
                          You'll see.  *NOTE* Use it with the -timer option,
                          as there is no exit.
