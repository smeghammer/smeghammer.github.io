Title                     Crazy.wad
Author                    Fred Lanier
Description               Crazy.wad is the second wad I've created,the 
                          first being Freddoom.wad. It's not that big   
                          it's difficult and fun. I'm getting better at
                          it. I think you'll see an improvement over the 
                          last one, however, It's not as good as some on
                          the market. Please send me some E-mail and let
                          me know what you think.
Additional credits        Ben Lanier my son and glich tester. He says
                          the wad is "weak" even though it took him 50
                          tries to complete it.
