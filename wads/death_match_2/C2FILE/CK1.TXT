Misc. Author Info       : Engineering dude who plays WAAAAAY to much
                          DOOM ][!

Description             : This DOOM II pwad was designed with 2/4-player 
                          deathmatch in mind.  It's got no monsters UNLESS 
                          you use -SKILL 4 or 5.  This will present you 
                          with a "Final Enemy" like the dude on level #32 
                          (I'm to lazy to put monsters in, so this way, 
                          it'll randomize it for me :)  Lots of dark 
                          corners/rooms to hide in to surprise your buddy.  
                          All weapons except the Plasma Gun and the BFG9000 
                          are there, you've just got to look for them 
                          (I dont like the P.G. or BFG in deathmatch...  
                          spend a long time getting ammo and one flukey shot 
                          from the BFG and your SCReWeD! and the P.G. is a
                          stupid weapon! (:-)

                          Also, if you're wondering what the "jail" is for,
                          well, notice the door can only be OPENED like 
                          normal.  It has to be closed from another spot and
                          CANT be opened from the inside.  You take it from 
                          there...  >:-)
