** NOTES: **

This level will only work with registered versions of DOOM.

     To play this level unzip the files to your DOOM directory.

type DOOM -FILE CJDE1L1.WAD

to start DOOM.  Then just play episode 1 level 1.  There is also a demo
of this level included in the pwad.  It will play if you start doom as
stated above and then do nothing.  Just like the real doom!  This level is
fairly easy at lower levels but is difficult on the hardest levels.  There
are two "secret" areas in the level.  If you can find them, the level is much
easier.

This pwad was constructed using DEU5.1 and then run through BSP1.1x
The level works great except for a few quirky display problems in the last 
area of the level.  This is caused by one of two things.  Either this area 
is too complicated for any of the node builders I have found, or it is too 
complicated for the DOOM engine itself.  It may be that there are too many 
2S linedefs on the screen at one time.  The problems only manifest themselves 
when crossing some sectors.  I chose to leave it the way it was rather than 
change it because I liked the way the level played.  If anyone has any 
ideas on this leave a message at my E-mail address.

I have put many hours into this level, I hope you enjoy it.  It turned out 
that some of my ideas were very complicated for me to translate into a 
seamless looking and playing level.  They may not look complicated during 
game play, but were during the creation of the level.  There also was a big
learning curve for me in learning how to use the editor, and the structure
of the wad.  DEU5.1 is great, get it.  Also, this level would never have
worked without the BSP1.1 node builder. Special thanks to Colin Reed for
creating it.

Any comments or suggestions send to me at craig.dudle@aquila.com.

Thanks,  Long live DOOM!
