Misc. Author Info		: I'm SYSADMIN and SYSPGMR for supercomputing
				  with no time on my hands, but make time for
				  the most important thing: DOOM!

Description			: Originally designed as a fairly simple WAD
				  with deathmatch in mind, gradually grew to 
				  a fairly large level suitable for good one 
				  player action. Basically, prepare to chase 
			           	  and be chased in deathmatch mode, and run 
				  like hell in UV single player mode. Have 
				  included my favorite items from id's original
				  levels, namely teleporters, certain textures
				  and a few secrets with some attention to 
				  lights and lighting. Hope you find it 
				  enjoyable.

Known Bugs			: Some lower inside walls exhibit strange

				  sound into the wall !. Other weapons show 
			                  puffs of smoke (wall hits) on some walls 
				  but not on others, appears to be related to 
				  "sector within sector" creation.
