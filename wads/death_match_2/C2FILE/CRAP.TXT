        First attempt at a Pwad file, and it shows! The most useless PWAD file
EVER made, only use is to show you how NOT to make a PWAD file. I'm sure that
if it were to work fine, then it wouldn't have been to bad. As it is, I
couldn't be bothered adding more to the file and so I've uploaded it to prove
that although editing may seem easy, it is not if you're in a rush like me <g>.
The bugs can be fixed within a few minutes/hours. Give it a shot and look at
all the bodies lying on the floor due to the incredible mirroring <g>!!!!!
