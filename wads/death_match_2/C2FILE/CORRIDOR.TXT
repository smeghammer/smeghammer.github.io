Description             : A 4 player Deathmatch for Doom II, works fairly well
                          for 2 players also. Basically this WAD is a square with
			  four corridors connecting it to a larger square corridor.
			  There are four rooms containing the weapons. All weapons
			  are present in this WAD. The BFG is semi-hidden, though 
			  once you find it it is no problem to get. The main square
			  is a pool of life stealing blood, with a column in the
			  center that has a megasphere on it. The sphere will be 
			  hard to get unscathed in a 4 player match, as the apron
			  around the blood pool is dark, and can easily be covered 
			  from a distance or upclose. The line defs that trigger
			  the column to come down are too close to allow a turbo-ing
			  player to whiz by without a shot being fired at him.

* Construction *

Base                    : An original work 
Build Time              : One snowy Saturday afternoon
Editor(s) used          : Edmap v1.21 ( v1.23 has problems, v1.24 freaks out my mouse...) 
Known Bugs              : None that I know of.
Problems encountered    : When connecting the corridors, and then play testing, the
			  sectors then behave as one when selected, so that I cannot
			  change the floor or ceiling textures without changing them all.
			  I am not sure if it is the program or the way I make the WAD...
			  Also I have not yet discovered how to make WADS for different 
			  Maps or combine different WADS for several Maps into one WAD.
			  If anyone reads this can tell me, please e-mail me.
