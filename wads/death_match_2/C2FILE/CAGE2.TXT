Misc. Author Info       : LF: Caffeine addict, improver extra-
                              ordinaire, desperately seeking Ms. Right
                              (but would settle for Ms. Right Now)
                          BF: Doom2 junkie, loves cookies,
                              Drinks Pepsi (no ice)
Description             : It's new! It's improved! It's the next in the Cage 
                          series!  For Deathmatch only.  Less Simple, More 
                          elegant.  Sleeker, more intricate.  Less filling,  
                          tastes great!  Deadly (try it with four).
                          *NOTE* Use it with the -timer option, as there 
                          is no exit.
