Misc. Author Info       : Second best deathmatch master of Austin

Description             :.A deathmatch only map which looks pretty cool. An open castle with four towers and a medium sized courtyard. Also several separate areas off of the main courtyard. Good sniping. Some tough puzzles in order to get all of the power ups. All weapons are available. Some of the pillars in the courtyard are lifts activated by remote switches, some are imobile. The NW and SE towers can only be accessed by teleporting in or by rematerializing there after you've been fragged. The teleport puzzle is a little tricky to figure out, its almost impossible to utilize with four players. I hope you all like it. It's my best effort yet, I believe.

Known Bugs              : Why would I post it with bugs? Well, there is one minor glitch that doesn't affect game-play: When you look from the NE tower towards the SW tower you might see a slight HOM effect. The only way to eliminate the effect would be to remove some of the two-sided lindefs in the area of the HOM effect. I decided to tolerate the problem rather than change the map. Let me know if the problem causes crashes.
