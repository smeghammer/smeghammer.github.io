Description             : This is my first level, folks, so be gentle with
			  me. It was intended for Death Match Play but will play 
			  on all levels.
			  Enjoy.

Instructions            : Put JJE2M2 in your DOOM directory,

Disclaimer              : I assume no responsibility for anything of any sort
			  in any way, shape, or form, now, then, henceforeward, 
			  in this life (or the next several) for any screw-ups
			  or even minor inconveniences this PWAD causes you,
			  your family, your relatives, friends, ancestors,
			  associates, employers, pets, neighbors, lovers,
			  deities (major AND minor), nor any other person --
			  living, dead, or undead -- that you have or will ever
			  have any contact with in even the slightest form.
			  This PWAD has been tested and tested ad infinitum, so
			  it shouldn't mess with your computer or anything else
			  remotely associated with it.  But if it DOES, then
			  too damn bad.  Don't come cryin' to me.  It must be
			  something YOU did.
