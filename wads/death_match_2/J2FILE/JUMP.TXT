Misc. Author Info       : Deathmatch finatic !!! ;)

Description             : This file is a modified version of episode 3
			  level 6.  I modified it for deathmatch play
			  and basically kept the same map, but re-colored
			  it,and raised and lowered some of the floors.
			  This level also contains an overkill of weapons
			  and health. (the name comes from the big JUMP in
			  the northern section of the map, 500 to -511)
