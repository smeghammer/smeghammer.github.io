Description             : My first attempt at a level.  
                          A good-looking, fun to play level
                          with some very intense moments.  
                          Somewhat challenging on HMP, though
                          unforgiving on UV. Possible to get 100%
                          kills, however.  New version; more polished  
                          than "johann.wad".  Fairly linear with very little  
                          in the way of "puzzle solving".  Featuring the
                          IMP Gauntlet and the BARON Arena!  Send comments

                          future...
