Description             : This is a neat little Deathmatch WAD. It's really a
                          different level every time you play it.                                

Misc Game Info          : DOOM II WAD. This WAD is error free. It's been play
                          tested for over 20 hours. It should run fine on a
                          386 or a 486. It's been played on both.

Additional Credits to   : Chris Rock for his input and play testing.
