Misc. Author Info       : Johann is the name of my evil alter-ego. :) 

Description             : I was trying to make a level that would be really 
                          fun to play, but also very good-looking.  I'm very
                          proud of this level and believe I have succeeded 
                          for the most part.  The "Hurt Me Plenty" setting is 
                          fairly challenging and UV is unforgiving, but it is
                          possible to get 100% kills (without cheating :) ).  
                          Not as hard as some of the other wads 
                          floating around, though.  I would recommend it to 
                          players who like a fairly "intense" DOOM experience 
                          with a minimum of "puzzle solving".  There are   
                          secrets, but not hard ones.  
                          I would appreciate any comments, so I can keep 
                          making better and better levels.  
                          I can give hints to anyone who wants them, just
                          e-mail. ENJOY!

Additional Credits to   : Dave Wickberg, for letting me use his PC and
                          for playtesting, the guys on 6th floor at UC Rez 
                          for playtesting.  Also, to the people who worked
                          on DEU (an excellent program!) and ID software.
