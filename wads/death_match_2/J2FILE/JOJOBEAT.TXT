       * SPECIAL FEATURE * 
       
        This wad has a crushing ceiling and enclosing walls that can 
        be activated via a control room. Use the skull switch to bring
        the red walls down. Then walk into the green triangle to start
        the crushing ceiling. After your opponent suffers an agonizing 
        death, you can then shut the crushing off by walking into the red
        triangle. This will also raise the red walls. Using the red
        walls to enclose can only work once, so make it count. 


        My friends and thought it was hilarious to watch each other bounce
        like popcorn in the Archvile pit!
