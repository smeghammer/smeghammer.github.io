        The D2PTEX.WAD file puts the missing textures/patches back into 
Doom 2 that were available in Doom 1.  It also rebuilds the SWxSTONE 
textures to look as they did in D1... in D2, the textures still exist 
but were changed completely.  This PWAD is very helpful for using converted
Doom 1 WADs with Doom2.  To use it with your converted WADs, just put the 
file into your \doom2 directory, and then at the command prompt type:

DOOM2 -FILE D2PTEX.WAD [the other wad(s) you want to add go here]
