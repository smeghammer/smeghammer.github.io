Description             : My attempt at finding the "flow" (That mystical
                          force that makes a deathmatch wad so fraggin' 
                          good!). Try it you'll like it!

Additional Credits to   : Tim "TIMinator" Ash, Ryan Saari and many others
                          for playtesting.

Notes                   : I decided to release this one again by itself after
                          I made a few small changes and added my own skill
                          levels.

                          Go ahead, get the rocket launcher (If you dare!).
