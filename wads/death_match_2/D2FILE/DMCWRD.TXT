- The Setting -
	
	The scene looks abandoned, but you soon come upon a room with four
  teleporters.  Which one will you take?  There's only ONE WAY OUT.
  	So judge carefully and MAYBE you'll make it.  We encourage you NOT
  to cheat, or you won't get the full effect.  Made with DoomEd - 'The Real Thing'
  v 2.60b by Geoff Allan 

					Happy Dooming!
