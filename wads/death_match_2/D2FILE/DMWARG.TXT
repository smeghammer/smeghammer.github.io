Description: During your intergalactic surveillance for UAC, you
stumble upon an abandoned alien facility which has been taken
over by the various inhabitants.  In order to free themselves
from the constant boredom of isolation, they have learned to
genetically enhance and clone themselves, and now they conduct
special games in which teams of monsters fight to the death in a
large arena.  This is where you come in.  You have full access to
the facility (of course), and must put an end to the carnage. 
You can play this as a regular level, or you can conduct your OWN
matches between the monster teams. There are four teams: The
Incredible Imps (AKA: the Incredible Pantsless Wonders), the
Sadistic Sergeants, the Tormenting Troopers, and the Demons of
Destruction.  You can release them at your own will by pressing
the four switches (each switch releases one team to the playing
field) which you can find in the control room.  It is best to
"instigate" by using the teleports in the control room which lead
to the playing field, and then teleport back to watch the chaos
unfold beneath your eyes.  This is all you need to know in order
to conduct your own mini-brawls. You should also notice the
various facilities at your fingertips: the Four-Star Cafeteria
(complete with some shrimp on the barbie), the deluxe owner's
boxes, and the underground cloning chambers.  Make sure you try
Deathmatch too (if you can); lots of great hiding places and
ambush points.
