"Dead on Arrival 12" is an addon level for registered doom.
It replaces Episode 1, Level 2.

DOA-11 has already been floating around for a couple weeks now.

DOA-13 is on the way!

This level is ideal for single player, cooperative or
deathmatch games.

Enjoy!

I used Geoff Allen's Doom Editor for Windows...great editor!
