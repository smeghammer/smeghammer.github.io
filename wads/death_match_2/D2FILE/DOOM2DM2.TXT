Description             : This is a NEW DEATHMATCH Only Level for Doom ][
			  Having received high praise for DOOM2DM1.WAD (and
			  also hving played it for hours and hours) I decided
			  to get to work on the next in the series. This level
			  is a bit bigger than DOOM2DM1 but it is so 
			  interconnected that the frag count will be high. All
			  weapons are present as is the MEGASPHERE but to get 
			  it, you'll be easy meat for your enemies..
Additional Credits to   : id for Doom, Doom][ , The DEU team (Where's DEU 5.3?)
			  Jens Hykkelbjerg for RMB2 , Matthew Ayres for WADED 
			  (needed it for the new flats. the DEU hack I have
			  doesn't have them)

Additional Notes        : What can I say? This is a DEATHMATCH **ONLY** level
			  so shoot when you see your buddies and stop playing
			  with yourself! (You'll go blind!)
			  No HOM's, Medusa, or Tutti-Frutti effects..

                          Please send me any comments or suggestions for 
                          improvement.
