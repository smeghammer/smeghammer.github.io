Description             : Final Transmission of Agent Brendan Raphael
			  Blaskowiecz:
				When I arrived on Planet Deum last night
				I teleported into the offices of the ware-
				house. Disguised as a Cacodemon I was easily 
				able to maneuver through the mazelike corridors
				until I found the teleporter that took me to 
				the computer facility. In the computer facility
				I discovered crushing ceilings and after much 
				carnage was able to locate the teleporter to 
				the penal facility. This led to the surface 
				where, after sneaking by a spider demon I 
				arrived at the door to the exit. I am opening 
				the door right ARGHHH....... 	
				END OF TRANSMISSION. 
				You will now be deposited into the warehouse 
				where agent Blaskowiecz was sent. You must 
				retrace his steps and discover his fate.
