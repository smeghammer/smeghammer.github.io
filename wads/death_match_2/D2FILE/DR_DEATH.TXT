Description             : Each Player begins alone in a little room with 
			  some Bonus-Items. Choose one, and let the game
			  begin! If You die, You restart in one of the 4
			  rooms. (It's the only way to reach them...) 
			  And then... (You'll see!!)
			  Have fun, and send me a mail how You liked it...
