Description             : This is a DOOM II pwad that was designed
                          specifically with 2-player Deathmatch 2.0 in
                          mind.  Works pretty well with 4 players too.
                          It is very difficult to get to the exit in
                          a one player game.  It took me a lot of times
                          to finally pass it.  If you like this wad,
                          LET ME KNOW!
