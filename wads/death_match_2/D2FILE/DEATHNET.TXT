Description             : A collection of 5 Doom II deathmatch wads.
                          
                          Level 1 - RERUN.WAD Modified E1M1 from Doom I.
                          Added Doom II weapons and monsters, with a couple
                          new "secret" doors and goodies. An old favorite
                          updated.  Have fun.

                          Level 2 - CONDO.WAD compact deathmatch level.  With 
                          4 players on a net this is a "frag-a-second" wad.  
                          Lots of places to set up an ambush, but don't stay 
                          in one place too long. Don't fall in the gue.

                          Level 3 - BIGFART.WAD Another fast, action packed 
                          compact deathmatch level.  No gue or barrels to 
                          suicide yourself with.

                          Level 4 - INSANE.WAD

                          Level 5 - MAP_32A.WAD Modified Doom II level 32 
                          (Wolfenstein). Fine tuned to authors taste for 
                          deathmatch.
                          
                          All levels excellent for strategic or 
                          all-out-fraggin' deathmatch play.
