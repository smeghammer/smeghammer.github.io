Description             : Hopefully this'll be a rad deathmatch level.
                          It's my first level made in EdMap, an awesome
                          level editor!  I haven't even played anyone
                          on it yet, so let me know how it is.

Additional Credits to   : Id software, the guy(s) who made EdMap and DEU.

Base                    : New level from scratch
Editor(s) used          : EdMap and DEU
Known Bugs              : The teleporters .. the textures seem unaligned
                          in a wierd way.  Also when looking
                          towards the teleporters, the sky is messed up..
                          If anyone knows how to fix these, PLEASE!!!
                          email me.

* How this WAD was made *

This WAD sort of evolved over 2 days .. first I just made the fountain 
area and got used to EdMap.  I wanted there to be a big central area that
everything revolved around (the sky-lit area).  Then I just added on some
side areas.  Hopefully, it'll be really easy to get from any one point
on the map to another.  I hope those teleporters work out cool!  I can't 
wait to be running away from someone and they'll think they'll squash
me and end up far away!
