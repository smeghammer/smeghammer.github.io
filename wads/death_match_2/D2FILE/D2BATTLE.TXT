Description             : This wad was designed as a battleship 
                          mainly for Deathmatch 2.0. There are 
                          many "secret" switches, that lead to
                          traps, bonuses, and all kinds of good
                          stuff. There are quite a few monsters
                          lumbering around for carnage purposes.

Misc Game Info          : You must check everywhere!!  I tried to
                          make some secrets sorta obvious... with
                          textures, alignment, objects, and so on.
                          but some secrets are carefully hidden.
                          This is a very challenging single player                          
                          level, some of the newest monsters can
                          wreck you in a hurry, and there are about
                          70 of them in a relatively small level.

Additional Credits to   : Raj Rhanjan - many hours of play testing
                          and developmental motivation (he brought
                          the beer)

                          Keith Pronowicz - traps, trickery, and all
                          sorts of nasty stuff... (someone buy him a 
                          REAL modem, please)

                          Viper - Playtester Extrordinaire. (scum beats 
                          me every time, too...)
