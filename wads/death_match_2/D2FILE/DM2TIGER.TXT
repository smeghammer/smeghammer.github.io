Description           : You are trapped in enemy land, a den of tigers.
                        The only way to escape is to combat the enemies
                        and steal their keys. Good Luck!

Additional Credits to : Kelly for her patience with the long nights at the
                        computer; Richard for the ideas and modem testing.

Notes                 : This wad progresses in stages. You have to acquire
                        the keys and hit the right switches to move on. 
                        The keys aren't hidden. The one thing I hate most 
                        about some pwads is that you have to solve a puzzle 
                        to complete it. I like to kill and thats what 
                        motivated me to build this pwad. The keys are well 
                        protected, the red especially. Look for secrets 
                        to better yourself and condition, not to exit the 
                        wad. Also don't get to comfortable in rooms you may
                        have been in before and cleared of enemies. Trap 
                        doors and booby traFps abound. Also, this level is 
                        cheat code proof. You have to visit the every room
                        to complete the level. Giving yourself the keys by 
                        typing will not work. You have to earn them.
