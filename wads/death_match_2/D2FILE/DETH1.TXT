Misc. Author Info       : Note that I'm uploading this two days
                          before the summer recess, so I won't
                          be able to read my mail very often, if
                          at all. Sorry. If you really must
                          contact me, mail it c/o University of
                          East Anglia, Norwich, England NR4 7TJ.

Description             : Originally intended as a two-player
                          DeathMatch blast, this level is made
                          for high-speed friend-killing carnage.
                          It does play OK on single player, though,
                          as the (reasonably) action packed demo
                          shows. This demo shows you all the hidden bits
                          as well, so as to make DeathMatch games fair.

                          We (Andr‚ and Tim McLachlan) wrote some new
                          music for our first levels, but it sounded
                          really awful on SoundBlaster. (well, Pantera-
                          style drums are hard to get right at the
                          best of times!) If people really want more
                          music (and I can see how they might, the
                          number of times I've heard the E1M1 music)
                          then E-Mail Tim MacLachlan about his music
                          library. He's on summer recess too, so don't
                          expect a prompt reply.

                          If your version has some additional wads
                          (THRASH.WAD, TWILIGHT.WAD) then these
                          contain the music and you can include it
                          with DOOM -file <level> <music>.

                          Oh, yes. The tutorial that comes with DEU 5.2
                          says that you can't align textures around
                          windows and doors. This is not the case, I'm
                          happy to say (take a look at the vine-covered
                          structures and the marble edifice of you don't
                          agree).
