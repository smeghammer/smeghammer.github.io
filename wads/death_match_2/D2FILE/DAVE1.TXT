Misc. Author Info       : My second WAD file, big improvement over my                       
                          first attempt.

Description             :Big level with lots of special lighting and a few   
                         other special effects. You have to watch your back
                         in this one. Also, lots of area left to add to if
                         you have DoomED-The Real Thing editor.Availible in
                         the Gamer's Forum as DMREAL.ZIP. I'd highly
                         recommend this editor
                         

Additional Credits to   : id, for making DOOM and Geoff Allan for making 
                          DoomED-The Real Thing Editor. Also special thanks 
                          to my wife for helping beta test this floor and
                          watching the kids so I could spend the better part
                          of a Saturday making this floor.
