Misc. Author Info		: I'm Sysadmin for  supercomputing with no time on my 	                				  hands, but am totally controlled by demonic forces and 
				  have devoted myself to DOOM.
				 
Description			: A DOOM II combo deathmatch / single player wad, 					  designed (deathmatch) to allow for mad dashes into the
			              open under threat of sniper fire, as well as dark ambush 					  sites. Small enough to allow for all-out slugfests as well.     
				  Requires 2 switches be thrown to exit (not cooperatively) 
			              There are no nasty tricks or unsolvable traps.  
				  This wad designed for use with DOOM II and replaces
				  map01 (level 1).  
				  	
				  Hope you like it, if not please tell me why, so I can 					  improve my pwad designs. 				  ================================================================
