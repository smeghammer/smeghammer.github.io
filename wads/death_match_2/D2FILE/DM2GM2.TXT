                                  (All comments, suggestions and criticisms greatly
                                  appreciated; its way to quiet around here.
Misc. Author Info               : I'm Sysadmin for  supercomputing with no time on my
                                  hands, but am totally controlled by demonic forces and
                                  have devoted myself to DOOM.

Description                     : A DOOM II combo hunt'em deathmatch / single player
                                  wad. Rather spread out, lots of open areas with little
                                  obstruction. Take a while and explore this wad, think
                                  you may find it interesting. Contains 6 teleporter dest's.
                                  Hmm...what else, oh yeah a Cyberdeamon and Spider
                                  Demon together, should not be too tough though, as the
                                  area has good vantage points/ sniper locations.
                                  There are no nasty tricks or unsolvable traps.
                                  This wad designed for use with DOOM II and replaces
                                  map01 (level 1).

                                  Hope you like it, if not please tell me why, so I can
                                  improve on design. ANY and ALL Feedback Welcome!
