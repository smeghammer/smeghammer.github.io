    ---- Daemon Version 2 Level ---

    "And you thought Imps were bad"



This is version 2.0 of deamon.wad.  It's a standard level

with a deathmatch component.  I haven't tried it in

deathmatch (yet).


This version fixes the hall-of-mirrors effects (which were my

fault due to my construction and mode-type for the doors :)

It also includes several more rooms and traps, plus more

"murder holes" for deathmatch.


Deamon2's got some nasty traps - so watch out!  >:-)


If you like levels with puzzles and nifty effects, then Daemon 2

is for you!


Except for texture and alignment, please email me about bugs you

find.  I'd also like to know what you think of it!


Thanks to the authors of DEU 5.0 and BSP 1.0.

This wad was created using DEU 5.0 (non-beta) and running the

output through BSP.


Have fun!
