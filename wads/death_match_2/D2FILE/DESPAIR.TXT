Description            : After a weekend of R&R, you return to your base to 
			find your unit has not returned from routine maneuvers 
			on Mars. Upon checking in with your CO, you find him 
			a changed person. He only mumbles, "Despair, Despair, 
			Why did it have to be Despair." Your comrades had been 
			sent to pay a routine visit to OCP's genetics and 
			physics lab knicknamed "Despair" because of its remote 
			location Grabbing your sidearm, you head for the hanger 
			to begin your search for the fate of your comrades.

			This is my first complete level, so please bearthis 
			in mind. Please E-Mail me with your comments on CIS.

			and of course, those great people at id, without 
			which we would not have the pleasure to play DOOM.

			their help and inspirations.

Instructions          : Put DESPAIR.WAD and DESPAIR.BAT in your DOOM directory,
			then run the batch file.  This takes you right into it,
			skiping the intro stuff, chooses "Hey, Not Too Rough" 
			skill, and jumps right into the level.  Modify the 
			batch file with -skill # as you please. Otherwise, 
			choose New Game, Shores of Hell, and the skill level 
			you preferand play thru as normal.
