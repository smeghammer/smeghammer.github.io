Description             : A Big, fast-action DOOM ][ Deathmatch Wad.
                          Good ambush spots, but don't stay in one 
                          spot too long.  This is a frag-a-second 
                          style wad.  With 4 players, someone will 
                          always be getting fragged.

                          Check out the MAP!!!!!!
