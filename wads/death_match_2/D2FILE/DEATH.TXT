Hello,

This WAD was created by Jason Whittington (jawhitti@mailhost.ecn.uoknor.edu)
using DEU - the Doom Editor utilities Beta, available at ocf.unt.edu as
DEU5BET4.ZIP in the uploads directory.  Fell free to email me with comments/
suggestions, but not for help with DEU.  Please also feel free to distribute
it to your friends, but please do not modify it and distribute it.

To play this level run DOOM -FILE DEATH.WAD and select episode 1/Ultra
violent.  It also makes for great DEATHMATCHes!!

Special thanks to Raphael Quinet (quinet@montefiore.ulg.ac.be) for DEU.
Great program!

Happy DOOMing!!
