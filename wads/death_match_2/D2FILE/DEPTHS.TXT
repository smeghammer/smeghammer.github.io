Notes:                  : This is the first of a planned three-mission
                          episode.  I am uploading it now, so that I can 
                          get feedback on design issues, since this is my
                          PWAD.

Description             : You have landed on the surface of the planet below.
                          Intelligence has told you that below the surface, 
                          there are two more levels.  On the surface, mostly
                          there are rogue creatures, and the quest is to find
                          the passage to the hell-hole below.

                          Once on the second level, it becomes clear that it is an
                          area used mainly for storage, use and disposal of toxic 
                          waste.  Apparently, these dudes are not environmentally-
                          correct.

                          At the third level, you realize that have sunk to the depths
                          of hell.  It's damned hot down here, and you'd better
                          find a way out...pronto!
