Description             : This level is designed especially for
                          deathmatch. It's great fun for two
                          players games, and really boring with one
                          player, becuase theres no monsters... but,
                          it's a great 2-3 player deathmatch wad
                          

Note:                     This level was made from scratch, with the main
                          idea from Deathme.wad for DOOM. So thanks, to 
                          who ever made that!


Additional Credits to   : Raphael Quinet, Brendon J. Wyber and Colin Reed, for
