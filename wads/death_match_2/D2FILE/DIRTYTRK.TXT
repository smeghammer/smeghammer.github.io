Description             : Replaces E2M1.  Emphasis is on exploration
                          and dirty tricks.  My first attempt at  
                          building a level.  Hope it isn't too boring.
Additional Credits to   : My sons, who play tested it and kept me from
                          getting too crazy with the monsters:  "NOBODY
                          could get through here, Dad!".
