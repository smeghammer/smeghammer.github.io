Description             : large custom PWAD.  May run a bit slow on some
			  systems.

Special Thanks          : Dr. Spencer Kwong who admirably attempted to test
                          this version using an IBM Value-Point with its 
                          famous mouse compatibility problem.

Additional Credits to   : Those of you responsible for DEU521, BSP,
                          and the wad modifiers DMGRAPH, DMMUSIC, and
                          DMAUD...
                          And of course, everyone working at:
