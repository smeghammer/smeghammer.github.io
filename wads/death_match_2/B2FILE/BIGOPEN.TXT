Description             : Thought I'd stretch the DOOM engine a bit. This
                          level is wide open, with six main areas. Its the 
                          biggest PWAD I've made or ever seen. That is, big
                          in area, not sectors and such. 
                          It did hang the game for unknown reasons, so 
                          maybe there is a size limit. Its too big for a 
                          good deathmatch unfortunatly, though the starts
                          are there.
                          I like the sense of moving to a distinct -new-
                          area. DOOM has little continuity...one area, hit a
                          switch, poof, new area.  I would prefer a future
                          with a wide open map...quake? You only get a
                          sense of that here.
