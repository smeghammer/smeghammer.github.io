First off, I'd like to thank everyone who has given us such positive 
feedback on BASTARD1.WAD.  I've had several requests to post that file
to infant2 (as before it had only been on ocf, and is now "lost").  
However, Mike and I have already gotten quite a bit done on our
episode, so we decided to go ahead and post the first three levels of
our episode.  Hope you enjoy playing them as much as we did making them!

Note: There have been a few minor changes in Level 1 since our first upload.

Description: 

First three in a series of nine maps which together will comprise the "It's a
Bastardly Day in the Neighborhood" episode.

Level 1:  Well, you made it out of Hell all right, but the second you get
home, you hear teleport sizzles all around you...those bastards have
followed you!  Looking out the window, you can see they've got the
building surrounded...and you can hear the grunts of mutant soldiers coming
from inside your door...

You've fought those bastards on their own turf and won.  Now they're back to
even the score.  Fortunately, you've got a few tricks up your sleeve...
not to mention your general issue pistol...

Level 2:  Sewer Level

Level 3:  Waste Treatment Plant
