The Story So Far:	: Getting the key was easy, but I couldn't wash
			  off my blood stained hands. Sure the bazooka
			  helped but could not stop the nightmare I was
			  living.  The walls got me dizzy and I had this 
			  crushing feeling.  Just when I thought I was 
			  in the clear, my feet started to heatup. I hope
			  I live long enough to see Earth again.
