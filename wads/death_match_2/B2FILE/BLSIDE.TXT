DESCRIPTION             : Think the original Doom2 levels were hard ?? ....
                          You are in another WORLD now...The instant you 
                          move, BLINDSIDE! Does it ever end ?? You probably
                          won't forget the name, but in case you do, do a
                          180 just before hitting that exit switch...

INSTRUCTIONS            : DOOM2 -file blside.wad    THAT'S IT !!
                          As stated in the Gamers+ Forum description, a 486
                          OR BETTER is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED ! This level 
                          WILL play SLOW on lesser machines - Sorry, but
                          that's the 'nature of the beast'...

ADDITIONAL CREDITS TO   : Where to start... 
                          -First of all, Jim F. Flynn for many hours of 
                           brainstorming with me, his excellent conversion 
                           utilities, and many good ideas.
                          -id software for Doom & Doom2 (can we get those 1.7
