Known Bugs              : The dark octagon room is blurred when you're not  
                          standing close to the center. I think the room is
                          just too big.

Miscellaneous Stuff     : While travelling through the many homemade levels we 
                          got pretty ticked off that so many authors created areas
                          that you could fall into and never be able to get out. 
                          That is the stupidest thing in the world!!!!  To all of 
                          those authors--"Go to Shores of Hell".  We made this level
                          with all of the things we like best:  Major Goat Dudes, 
                          Big Clomping Guys, Huge Eyeballs, and Pink Bulls.  All of
                          the weapons are here, you just have to find them.  We 
                          didn't make it that difficult to do so.  Good strategy is
                          a must. If you've played Wolfenstein then you know what we
                          mean. If you haven't played Wolfenstein then you are a moron!
                          This is probably far from the best level you have played, but 
                          we think it's a lot better then some of the crap out there!

                          If you hate this level let us know. If you like it do the same
                          we want to hear from you.
                          
                          Well good luck-Cap two guards in a road gang!!!
