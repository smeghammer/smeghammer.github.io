                          Don't expect any wads next semester! :)

Description             : This PWAD is for E1M1.  It was designed primarily
                          for deathmatch, which is apparent in the design.

Additional Credits to   : Bill Archer, Joshua Levens, Cheong Choi

Additional Notes        : As stated above, it was designed primarily for
                          deathmatch.  It really wouldn't be that fun
                          in single user mode, and could probably be 
                          completed in under a minute.

                          Please send me any comments or suggestions for 
                          improvement.

Additions since last ver: Shuffled placement of guns to make it a little
                          more dangerous to get the powerful weapons.  
                          I also kept Deathmatch 2.0 in mind when I placed
                          the items so med kits are out of the way, and it 
                          way get you killed trying to get at 'em!
