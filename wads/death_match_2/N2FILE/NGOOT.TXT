This is a Wad file for Registered Doom only Produced with DEU 5.1

Ngoot means Now Get Out Of That!   to run this wad file you need to
enter the following command line.

doom -file ngoot.wad

This file is in its design stage still so there may be some mistakes
but all in all it is a rather large and difficult level to complete
without cheating.... Specially with 5 Barons protecting the only path to
the exit :-)

Hope you enjoy it....
