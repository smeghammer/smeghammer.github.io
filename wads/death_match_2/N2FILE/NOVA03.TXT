Title                   : Nova's Wad v3.0
Filename                : nova03.wad
Author                  : Andrew Baker
Misc. Author Info       : I BETA test for EdMap and several other Doom Utils.
			  I had a ton of spare time so I made this PWAD.
			  School has gone down the drain since Doom was 
			  released, and I'm loving every bit of it!

Description             : DeathMatch PWAD I made while I was BETA testing
			  EdMap 1.24.  ALL the Weapons in Doom 2 are in
			  this PWAD, just look for 'em!  I used most every
			  feature in EdMap in the the process of making 
			  this PWAD.  If your playing this with anything
			  other than DeathMatch then you must have no life,
			  and like to play with yourself.  Enjoy it damnit!
