Description             : **** Optimised for DEATHMATCH 2.0 ****
                          This wad is designed for three to four player
                          deathmatch. This Wad has been extensively play
                          tested, and has proven to remain interesting
                          over long periods of play.
                          It is also in strong contention for inclusion in
                          an upcoming DooM Tournament to be held in
                          Canberra, Australia.

                              The first time I played it I clocked the 
                              frag counter. Highly recommended...."

                              relationship would have ended. In this wad
                              Andrew shows true talent as a DooM editor. 
                              But, then again I could just be biased."
