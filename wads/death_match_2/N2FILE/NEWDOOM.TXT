NEWDOOM.WAD

This PWAD represents the combination of just 27 of some of the best levels 
I have found on the net.  I say best meaning that they convey the spirit of 
the game, and are done with focus on quality.  Also, they had to run 
reasonably well even on a 386/40, which is my deathmatch partner's machine.  
I did NOT create any of the levels, I only used Movelev (c. Steve Simpson) 
to renumber them, and DEU (c. Raphael Quinet & Brandon Wyber) to group (and 
edit if needed) them.  And of course BSP11W (c. Colin Reed) for redoing the 
edited wads' nodes so quickly.

They are definately texture, monster, and thing protected from usage by 
Shareware DOOM.  These were compiled to provide the most compatibility with 
multi-player, deathmatch, and solo settings--Not favoring one setting over
another.  You get some of everything with this PWAD, and it's excellent in
groups.   

Listed are the levels, their order, and the author's name.  All levels can 
be FTP'd via Internet FTP from infant2.sphs.indiana.edu.  Their respective
text files have been included in the zip file with this wad.

Also, the secret levels are mostly puzzles that don't work too well in Death
matches (hence why I give ya a choice of going to them or not), except 2-9.

Note:

	If you have DEU you can make this PWAD file into a full IWAD file 
to take the place of the main doom.wad file.  Just use the 'r'ead command
to input this wad, then the 'b'uild command to build it into a 27 level 
totally new doom.wad.  Remember, rename your old doom.wad first, or name
the new wad newdoom.wad or something like that.  And of course, without
the registered doom.wad file you won't be able to run this PWAD, or build
it into a full DOOM, so don't even think about it :)
