Misc. Author Info       : This is my first PWAD, version 5.

Description             : I named it VAMPIRE5 because...catchy name!
                          Better than FRODO5, my handle.  Anyways.
                          This was made w/ DeathMatch in mind.
                          About half the time making this was spent
                          playing it to make sure everything looked
                          nice.  I wanted an artistic PWAD as well as
                          a fun one.  Most of the rooms were done on
                          paper first.  Much time has been spent
                          thinking about how things will be placed
                          and if they'll "work well" there.
                          Story:  trapped in Count Frodo's castle,
                          you must escape the evil vampire's traps
                          and make it out alive.  His creatures will
                          try and stop you from escaping.  Can you
                          find Count Frodo's secret teleport room?
                          Can you master the Plus Sign??  Can you
                          find the hidden weapon in the Infinity room?
                          Discover all the great snipe spots!
