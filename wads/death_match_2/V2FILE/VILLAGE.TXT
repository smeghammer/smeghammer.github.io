Description             : As you wander across the surface of hell,
                          you stumble across a village. Except for a
                          few guards, it looks quiet enough. Although,
                          the thick stone walls are a bit odd. So you
                          decide to look inside the buildings. Big
                          mistake...

                          This level is all about mazes, and the
                          various ways they can be implemented. Some
                          of the mazes are devious in the extreme, but
                          you shouldn't have to cheat. There are few
                          true secrets.

Known Bugs              : There are several places where a single
                          sector is subject to multiple actions. Doom
                          can screw up if you try to do too many
                          things at once. A general rule is to move
                          slowly. Let each stage complete
                          before moving onto the next stage. DON'T
                          wake up monsters until you have to.

* Note from the author *

This level complements castle.wad. Imagine that this is the village at
the foot of the castle.

I'd like to see a perfect LMP for this level on ultra-violent. I'm not
good enough to do this myself, but a real pro shouldn't have too much
difficultly.
