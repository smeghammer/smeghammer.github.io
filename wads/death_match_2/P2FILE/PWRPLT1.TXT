Description             : A new twist on pwad deathmatch creation..
                          a PWAD *MADE* for team play! some of the stuff
                          you just can't get without a partner ( Like
                          the BFG ) The BFG is a Trap, you can get TO it
                          alone, but you can't LEAVE it alone. ::Grin::
                          ( Phrasing completely intentional )

                          The exit room has more than one switch, ONLY ONE
                          IS THE TRUE EXIT! the rest lower the ceiling...
                          ::Grin:: see how eager you are to run for the exit 
                          now coward...
