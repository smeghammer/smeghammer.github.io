        The reports had just come in, those bastards had wiped out 
all of Bravo Company.  Reports of sacrafices, marines impaled, their hearts
ripped out while the poor souls where still alive.  Most of Bravo company 
was young, young all right, eighteen, nineteen.  Hardly out of boot camp,
and well, I guess it showed.  Now its time for the veterans to go in and take
some names, time for OPERATION - DEEP PURPLE.  

Gentleman, here is what we are up against.  Bravo company had mostly
the standard marine issue shotguns and chainguns.  But, one of Bravo's combat
engineer squads managed to break through the obstacles and store weapons
caches everywhere.  Gentleman, every weapon we have will be made available,
so find them and use them with EXTREME PREJUDICE.  

Two last things to remember.
First: Most of Bravo didn't make it past the first door, I don't know what
happened, all I know is that they are sacrifcial bait now.  So keep your
head up! 
Second: The engineers reported many sacrifice sites, or pentagrams, beware, 
the're a quick trip to hell.  I know the gates can easily be raised 
or broken, it'll be up to your team to find out how.

Well, that's it, we're all suited up, lets lock and load....
