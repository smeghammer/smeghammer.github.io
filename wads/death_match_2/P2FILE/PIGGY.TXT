Description             : Piggy, was designed for deathmatch.  I hoped 
                        : that this wad would be used in the Lithium BBS 
                        : Tourney and also for our weekly frag fest ritual
                        : at Matt's house.  I also had to reclaim <<MY>>
                        : wall textures. :)  Four player mode will be sure 
                        : to produce plenty of frags in deathmatch 2.0,
                        : and even more in 1.0.  This wad should acuarately 
                        : judge two players' Doom skills on in a 1-on-1
                        : match, since all of the weapons are here and 
                        : there is plenty of room to fight.  The plasma 
                        : gun is hard to get since this gun is responsible 
                        : for many deaths, but if you are playing in a two
                        : on two situation, your friend can flip the switch
                        : on the inside wall so you can warp out of the maze,
                        : without getting trapped.  Also notice how the 
                        : person picking up the plasma gun can't shoot out 
                        : under the ledge while standing on the platform.
