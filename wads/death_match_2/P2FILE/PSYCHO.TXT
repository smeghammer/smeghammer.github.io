          PSYCHO DEATH LEVEL by Kyle Kenny	      7/11/94
	
	Thanks for downloading my level, which I call the Psycho Death Level.  
To run this level, first copy it to your DOOM directory and type:
			DOOM -FILE PSYCHO.WAD
Then select Knee-deep In the dead (Episode 1), select any difficulty level, and
PREPARE TO DIE!!! This level is the toughest I have seen.  I am convinced that
it is IMPOSSIBLE to beat on the NIGHTMARE difficulty level (no codes!)
	Even I can't beat this level without using cheat codes, and I consider 
myself rather good at DOOM (plus, I made the level).  If you've played the level
and can't get out, remember to try every wall.  You never know where you'll find
a secret door...
	I've made other DOOM levels, but this is my best one so far.  One is
called BKWAD.WAD, and it is very small and tough, much like this one.  You can
give this level to anyone you want (kind of like "shareware")  and if you want 
you can even edit it.  I made this level from scratch using DEU 5.2.  It can be
used as a DEATHMATCH level, co-operative, or single-player.
	If you have questions, comments, or CONSTRUCTIVE criticism, you can 
contact me by E-mail (please do!) at:
				KyleKenny@AOL.COM
	      
	or maybe it's-->	Kyle Kenny@AOL.COM

I'm not sure if there's a space in there...

Thanks again and good luck,
			Kyle Kenny
