Description           : Here it is!  The lastest edition of the Piggy
                      : series.  With this version of the Piggy series
                      : I hoped to take care of some of the cheapness
                      : that has been taking place in all the other piggy
                      : wads.  Not so much in 3+ player modes, but mostly
                      : in 1-on-1 matches.  This problem was solved with
                      : the windows to catch some of the hiding out in the
                      : large rooms.  All the classic piggy features are
                      : included of course, the wood textures in the halls,
                      : the BFG room, and of course the arenas with the
                      : quick stair weapons.  The wad is really cool in 4
                      : player mode free for all or 2-on-2.  1-on-1 matches
                      : are finally fair for a change!  This wad can be used
                      : for acurate skill testing as well.  Enjoy!  Next
                      : in the series is on its way ;).
