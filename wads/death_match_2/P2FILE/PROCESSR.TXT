Description             : This used to be the UAC subterrainian
                          toxic waste processing plant, until
                          the mishap. Things went wrong, so they
                          called your team in to clean it up.
                          To think this all started with an early
                          morning waking dream where I visualized
                          the area where you start off, especially
                          the blue area off to your left.*8^)

Additional Credits to   : Rapheal and the rest of the DEU team,
                          Id of course :), my subconscious, the
                          BSP gang, and all you wonderfull people
                          out there on alt.games.doom.

Miscellanious Notes:
    Try to keep you head while playing this one, and make sure you
usr the right weapon at the right time. There's a few pshycological
tricks in this one. ;) Not too many 'puzzles' per se in this either,
but not everything is doing what you think it is. :)
