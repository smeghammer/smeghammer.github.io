Misc. Author Info       : Working on my own editor!  Very powerful...

Description             : This level was used for testing my DOOM editor,
                          DOOM Construction Set (DCS) 1.0.  It's a little
                          small, but I didn't want to spend all my time on
                          the level and not the editor!

Additional Credits to   : DEU authors (I'm using their find sector routine
                          in DCS).
