Description		: PEEKABOO is a deathmatch only level without
			  any monsters except your friend-become-prey.
			  It's stricktly move fast and kick ass from
			  begining to end. The level consists of a
			  few rooms connected to each other so the action
			  will always be constant. There are a few false
			  walls that make for good ambush sites.
			  The players start in one of four hallways
			  adjacent to a couple of rooms. They will each
			  find a Health Supercharge, Blue Armor, Shotgun,
			  and Chaingun. There's a Plasma Rifle and Rocket
			  Launcher in each of the rooms. The BFG 9000 is
			  located in a corner the big room. There's also
			  Medikits, Invisibility Spheres and ammo for the
			  small weapons scattered throughout.
			  There are TWO Teleporters in the big room that
			  will transport you to the North or South corners
			  of the hidden hallway above the big room. This
			  level is great in DEATHMATCH 2.0 as well as
			  regular Deathmatch. There is plenty of opportunity
			  for ambush. This is the second level in a new
			  Deathmatch only episode Gil and I are developing,
			  so keep an eye out for future levels.

Note			: There are no lame traps in any of my Deathmatch
			  levels (I believe the purpose of Deathmatch is to
			  pit yourself against your opponent, not fall in
			  some stupid acid pit without a way out.
			  There's also a clearly marked exit in each of my
			  levels in preparation for the episode or if you
			  just want to continue playing on the next level.
