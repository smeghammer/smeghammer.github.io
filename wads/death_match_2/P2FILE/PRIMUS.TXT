Description             :      This is my first WAD ever,so it is noticeably 
                          lacking some of the more sophisticated features like 
                          rising staircases etc.I wrote it as a learning 
                          experience.
				There are lots of monsters,and the play level 
			  is moderate.There are also a number of secret rooms
			  and no shortage of weapons.                          

Additional Credits to   : The folks at id Software ... (Brilliant work guys!)

                                            only thanks but also a registration 
                                            fee (its on the way!)

                                            and to make primus.wad available to 
                                            everyone. email: hamilton@nbnet.nb.ca

Build Time              : About 60 hours (40 hours frigging and 20 hours 
                          productivity) 
Editors used            : Waded and Dmaud
Known Bugs              : A small section of wall allows the player to walk 
                          through it. I couldn't figure this out so I 'solved' 
                          the problem by putting four pillars in front of it... 
                          Also, there is a slight glitch in one of the corridors.
                          I couldn't figure this out either, but since it is 
			  barely noticeable unless you know where to look I just 
                          said the hell with it!
			  I have a sneaking suspicion that these problems
                          represent bugs in Waded (although this is otherwise a 
                          fine product).

Usage                   : Put Primus.wad into your 'DOOM' directory and type:

				doom -file primus.wad
