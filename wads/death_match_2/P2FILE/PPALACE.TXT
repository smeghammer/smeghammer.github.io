* NOTES *

Level 1: Once you get the plasma gun it should be trivial. Exit Door 
is the Exit. There is a button that you need to hit to exit that 
is hard to find - use the map - it is behind the red doors.  
Kill the Cyberdemon (skill 4, Mutliplay only), before letting him 
out, with the invincibility.

Level  2:  You need to hit 6 buttons in the maze to exit. Two more 
buttons take you to secrets.  Go there AFTER the maze is up.   
One more button goes to red key.  In the big room hit the button 
in the middle of the room and RUN.  Take the lift to blue
key a few seconds after the ceiling goes up.  Watch for the trick 
ending.  Exit Door is exit. Deathmatch in a maze!

Level 3: Lots and Lots of difficult jumps, and nooks and crannies. 
Try to do the entire level without hitting the ground floor. The 
plasma gun run should slow you down; You can't see out, but everyone
can see - and fire - in.  Check out my apartment complete 
with cutting board. Lava does not hurt.  My favorite for deathmatch.

Level 4:  Deathmatch only.  It's still in the works. Add your own 
monsters if you like.  Check out the detail and the door that just
appears at the top of the fence.  Some places look like lower textures 
are missing, but it is just bizzare rendering.  Exit door is the exit.
You cannot get the BFG 9000.
