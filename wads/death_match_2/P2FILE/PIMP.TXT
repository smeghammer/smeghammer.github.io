Description             : This is a collection of 27 Doom1 wads which have
                          been converted to Doom2 format usind WadCat and
                          Wad1to2.  They are deathmatch wads specifically
                          designed for 2-player DMing.  They are, in my
                          opinion, the very best doom1 wads, both in terms
                          of playability and design.  The conversion process
                          changed some things that could not be helped, and
                          the various doom2 editors out do not seem to let me
                          correct the problems with ease, so some levels,
                          such as ledgesi, may be a little different than you
                          may remember.  Nevertheless, these wads are the very 
                          best out there.  When I converted them I changed all
                          the shotguns to super-shotguns. Make sure when you
                          play them to use the -timer option; otherwise
                          you will not be able to exit some levels.

                          They are, in order:

                          These wads look excellent as well as play well.
                          Manyof the top ranked wads on the DM Wads
                          ranking sheet play well but are designed poorly;
                          not so with these wads.  I have played hundreds of
                          different wads, and when these wads were converted
                          to Doom2, a very important and beautiful change
                          took place on many.  You first see it in the 4th
                          wad, but you get the full extent of it in Pueblo
                          wad.  Im sure the author had this in mind when he
                          made it.
                          Some notes on each wad:
                          Madmax: this is a new wad, but an excellent start-
                          ing wad.  The music is fitting; it is a pleasant
                          surprise, seeing as how the sounds and music come
                          from blob.wad.  You will see what I mean.
                          Bigempty:I made some minor changes to this, but it
                          still remains an excellent shotguns-only wad.
                          Jhldth1: This is my all time favorite wad.  Its fun
                          to play in, fun to wander around in, and any style
                          of fighting can be used.
                          Par-002c: I think this was named something else 
                          originally but Im not sure what.  I got it out of
                          another wad collection as I could not find it on
                          the various sites.  The background fits the theme
                          well, but not as well as in...
                          Pueblo: absolutely beautiful.  Well designed, 
                          originally made for a pro tourney, but never used.
                          Unfortunately the oven texture gets pasted onto 
                          the wall of the BFG secret room in ledgesi for some
                          reason during conversion, and other places too,
                          but its no big problem.
                          House: A classic wad.  Nothing but fun.  Well 
                          made, with weapons placed strategically.
                          myhouse: A very recent wad, but lots of fun.  Goes
                          after house perfectly.
                          tnplhome: Another home, wad, I made minor changes
                          to it to make more weapons.  Check out the toilet
                          and the stove.
                          usqe1m1: This is a college Student Union I think,
                          and its a lot of fun to run around in, although not
                          quite in the same vein as with myhouse.
                          kill: Another college building wad.
                          church: I tried to add a missle launcher to this, but
                          for some reason the editing program wouldnt let me.
                          But I did add deathmatch starts (which it did not
                          previously have) and some shotguns and other weapons.
                          Remember, God does not like BFGs on Holy Ground.
                          Tourney: A wad created for a tournament.
                          hitmeinf: a good arena wad, lots of fun.
                          ledgesi: The conversion process made minor changes
                          to make this wad not as fun (it removed the missle
                          launcher for some reason) but it is still the all-
                          time classic wad.
                          subway11:Like church, this wad was not originally 
                          for deathmatch play, but the minor changes I made make
                          it a lot of fun. You will see why when you meet up with
                          a guy in a tunnel.
                          area8: This wad looks neat, and is fun to play, although
                          the strategy level is not quite to the level its design
                          would lead you to believe.
                          joi-cm1: Oh Joi!  A small castle wad
                          blob: This wad is the largest in the collection, but
                          you can still find frags pretty easily.  Its a good
                          hunting wad.  This is where the funky sounds come from.
                          slapme: Another tournament wad.
                          butt: This one has lots of secrets, another classic wad.
                          Trideath: a good set of arenas.  The dark is fun.
                          Peace: another classic.  There is a secret here which
                          will hand you the match if you find it.  Watch the lmp
                          for clues.
                          markroom: the classic arena wad
                          phucked: an interestingly designed wad, annoyingly fun
                          to play in.
                          ledges4i: ledges's big brother.
                          markrm3: transporters can be annoying but also fun.
                          October: another small castle wad, well designed.

                          When you play this wad, I suggest you put in a -timer
                          5 or 3 or 7 limit in it so you can go through all of
                          them.  Our floor will be using this for a tournament.
                          Thanks to all the guys on my floor
                          who helped with the selection process; you don't
                          know how long it took me to weed through all the wads
                          out there and combine them in the proper way.
