Title          : ZEUS.WAD 
Author         : Stephen Renton
Description    : The ZEUS Level is a showpiece for what can be achieved 
		 with a colour scanner and a little (ha!) patience. Not a
		 technically stunning level design-wise, but a good taster
		 of things-to-come when other people pick up the idea of new
		 textures seriously. Music score not composed by anyone, 
		 Graphics and original idea by yours truly, 
		 and WAV sound effects by Nic Dyde at the Post Cafe,
		 rue de Bern, Geneva.

Additional Help: Christian Gerlier for beta testing, and shutting-up long 
		 enough for me to concentrate on the tricky bits, and Dave 
		 Hanson for something or other.
