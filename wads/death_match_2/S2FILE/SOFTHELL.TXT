Title                   : "SoftChoice goes to hell!!!"

Misc. Author Info       : IS worker who would rather play DOOM all day
                          that do his work... 

Description             : It's happened. SoftChoice Corporation's facade
                          has been broken and revealed to be the true
                          hell that it really is (THIS IS A JOKE DAVE!!!)
                          
                          Watch out for the CyberLord. There's ALOT of
                          room for him to walk around in, so look out
                          for him once you "activate" him...

                          If you've played SCC2.WAD, you already know this
                          WAD is HUGE!!! Check this one out... The same
                          thing, just better textures (I think), more
                          secrets... Just check it out...
                          
                          Oh yeah! And in response to public outcry over
                          lack of EXIT signs, I've conformed and put one in.
