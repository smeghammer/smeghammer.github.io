Description             : This file is the Doom ][ conversion and 
                          modification of tourney.wad, which was 
                          created especially for a 4-player 
                          deathmatch tournament. It has sniper 
                          points, open areas and all weapons in 
                          interesting places. The weapon placement 
                          is designed to make for an intense 
                          4-player altdeath deathmatch.
