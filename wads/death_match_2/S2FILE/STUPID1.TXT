Misc. Author Info       : bored mechanical engineering student
                          with too much time on his hands.

Description             : Enough tricks and traps to satisfy
                          everyone...
                          Quite possibly to first in a series
                          of STUPIDx.WADs depending on feedback.

Additional Credits to   : my roommates for testing the pwad and
                          putting up with my STUPID addiction to
                          this game.
