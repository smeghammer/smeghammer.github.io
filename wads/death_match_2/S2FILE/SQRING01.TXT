Description             : A DOOM2 level designed specifically for deathmatch
                          under 2.0 rules. (can be played in normal deathmatch
                          mode as well) It is basically four square sectors 
                          each seperated by teeth doors or short passages. 
                          These sectors are surrounded by an outer ring at a 
                          higher level that allows you to jump into the main 
                          playing area through windows. There is also a 
                          passage that runs straight through the middle of  
                          the level as well as a few teleports thrown in. 
                          Playing on skill levels 1 or 2 should give you a 
                          real suprise. (co-operative)
