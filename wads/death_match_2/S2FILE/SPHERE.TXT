Description             : A more or less symmetrical square maze.
                          It doesn't take long to get used to it so
                          its not something you'll get lost in.  There is
                          a central area with a couple of side rooms
                          and 'windows' seperating them from the central
                          area, and passages extending to either side
                          of the map.

                          The map is seperated into the blue, red and
                          brown areas.  The brown area is the center.

                          The deathmatch locations are completely fair,
                          you start in one of the four corners and
                          start in front of a double barrel shotgun.

                          At either end of the map are 'goals'.  There
                          is a narrow ledge beside a pool of lava, and
                          accross the pool is a seperate alcove.  There
                          is nothing in them and they are intended for
                          the sphere game.

                          SKILL 1-2 turn off the megasphere and the plasma

                          Not designed for single play.

                          Multiplayer:  You can play straight deathmatch,
                          works well.  Since the map isnt too large
                          you can ambush or simply hunt.  Works
                          well for any number of players, though 3-4 players
                          is definitely fast.  Skill 1-2 to take away
                          the megasphere and plasma

                          SPHERE GAME - HOW TO PLAY
                          intended for team play (2 on 2).

                          Choose the teams.  Decide who scores on what side
                          (red or blue).  The idea is to simply get
                          inside the 'goal' area on your target side.

                          MEGASPHERE
                          In the middle of the map is a pit that goes
                          up and down.  Inside it is a megasphere (+100%
                          health).  You need this to score.  Of course
                          if you grab it when the pit is down you are
                          very easy prey for your opponents.

                          HOW TO SCORE
                          The *only* way into the goal area is to jump
                          accross.  However the ledge is too narrow to
                          get a decent running jump, so the *only*
                          way to jump far enough is to get propelled
                          accross by a rocket blast.

                          However a rocket blast typically will do 140%
                          damage to you, killing you unless you have
                          more health.  There is no armor on the level,
                          only the one megasphere in the middle.

                          So, Ingredients for scoring:
                          Rocket Launcher (with one rocket) and
                          a MegaSphere (>140% health).

                          Get over to the ledge, about in the middle,
                          turn and face the wall.  Shoot the rocket
                          and blast yourself into the goal!  If you
                          miss, you die (this happens when you are
                          *really* under pressure)

                          Note to score in either the red or blue
                          area depending on your team.

                          SCORING
                          Once you've done this, alert the other players -
                          as long as you stay in there they can verify
                          that you have indeed scored.  Your team gets
                          one point.

                          Alternatively if scoring takes a while for you
                          guys the exits are at the end of the goal
                          area so you could play to one goal.

                          WINNING
                          Either play for goals only, or make a goal
                          count for 5/10 frags.

                          TACTICS
                          At any one time you can be doing a few things:
                          Getting big weapons
                          Covering the megasphere
                          Guarding your goal
                          Trying to score (getting launcher+megasphere
                                           and not getting hurt)

                          Scoring is a lot easier if one player concentrates
                          on getting the equipment and the other
                          player covers him and clears the way to the goal.

                          As well you can split the team into 1 player
                          defends and 1 player tries to score.

                          Teams that do not defend do *not* do well.
                          If you know your opponent has the ingredients,
                          race to your goal and try to stop him.  He
                          can come at the goal from either of 2 directions.
                          Remember to stop him from scoring you
                          really just need to shoot him a bit (once
                          with a shotgun) to put him under 140%

                          A permanently defending player may be wasted
                          manpower a lot of the time, but as long as
                          he is competent should be able to keep the
                          other team from scoring (or slow them) a lot.
