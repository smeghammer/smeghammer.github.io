Description: A sinister gang of mutants and mercenaries has converted 
Santa's sub-permafrost toy factory to nuclear weapons production.  
Clear them out so that the world's kids don't wind up with Plutonium in 
their stockings on Christmas morning!  Highlights include cheerful 
Holiday colors, a 1:1 scale Lionel trainset, a Holiday MAP greeting from
Ziffnet, and a climactic battle INSIDE a Christmas tree.

Additional Credits to: Raphael Quinet (for DEU), Adler (for DEUii), 
Colin Reed (for BSP), and all the folks at ID for their brilliant 
DOOM I and II games.
