Description:             This is my last level before DOOM ][.  I will
                         consider rebuilding this level and "The
                         Final Gathering" for DOOM ][ when possible.

                         You begin right next door to hell.  in a twisted
                         chamber used by hell spawn as a portal to the 
                         humans' realms.

                         You venture beyond the portal to find... the Shrine.
                         The shrine is a large complex that pays tribute to
                         the hell spawn.  Some what of a cross between an art
                         museum and a mausoleum.

                         The tourists and guardians are a little bit hostile.

                         Can you survive?

                         Some advice, you may get the rocket launcher early,
                         SAVE IT FOR WHEN YOU REALLY NEED IT!


Additional Credits to   : My wife.  She is absolutely the greatest gal
                          in the whole world.  A true DOOM widow at times
                          but alway delightful.

                        : ID Software - WOW!  Thank you so much.  This has
                          become a way of life.

                        : Collin Reed for the BSP Utility

                        : Raphael Quinet and Brendon Wyber for the awesome
                          DEU 5.21 editor.  You guys are brainiacs.

                        : My mother, the acadamy and all my grade school
                          friends..... ;)

Editor(s) used          : DEU DOS extender version, BSP, DMAUD, DMGRAPH

Build Time              : 100+ hours

Known Bugs              : None that I can find.  If you've followed my work
                          before you know that I'll fix bugs and make
