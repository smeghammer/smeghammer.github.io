Description             : This level was designed to be used in deathmatch
                          mode.....  You can play with it by yourself, but
                          chances are you could go blind!

Misc Game Info          : DOOM II WAD. This WAD is error free. It's been play
                          tested for over 20 hours. It was designed to be
                          played in deathmatch for maximum fraggin' action.
                          The Cyberdemons are only to keep things moving, and
                          to keep those wimps, who should not even be playing
                          deathmatch, inside or on the outside walls. In other
                          words... LEAVE THEM IN THE GAME!!!  (if you wish you
                          can take them out using the -nomonsters switch, but
                          you'll never reach the 10th level of enlightenment...)

Additional Credits to   : Special thanks goes to E-MAN (sacred holder of the
                          LOCNAR and next rightful ruler of the world!) for
                          making his brothers play (and die!) in my WAD.
