Description        : THE SEQUEL TO WICKED.WAD!    
		     2 levels - EPISODE 2 MISSIONS 1 and 2.
			     
		     Contains properly aligned graphics this time.

		     Level 1 is a small level that takes place in a converted 
		     castle that is now center.  Plenty of monsters (IMPS, 
		     SPECTRES, DEMONS, TROOPERS, AND A CACODEMON). More than 
		     enough ammo to get you through, if you can find it and 
		     make your way thru the maze.  We have warp zones, turbo 
		     lifts, switches, hidden rooms, doors that open when you 
		     least expect, materializing walkways, and ????

		     Level 2 is a medium sized level that has a Baron Of Hell 
		     in it. Plus the BFG 9000. You leave the tech center to 
		     explore the outside of the old castle.  There are acid 
		     pits, sacrificial alters, the maze-like caverns that are 
		     lit only by torches.  Warp zones galore. Can you find 
		     the correct switch to open those 3 doors that are next 
		     to each other. Too many things to list.

		     I hope you enjoy them. Comments, criticism or ideas are 
		     allways welcome.
