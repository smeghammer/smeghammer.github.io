Misc. Author Info       : Talks to the President lots - and gets
                          replies. He's 5"7', dark hair, male,
                          eyes are limpid pools of mud, spends
                          altogether too much time playing
                          around with other people's computers.

Description             : SECURITY TO THE BIDET! Jean Luc is
                          nowhere to be seen, the security team
                          was toasted hours ago and Deanna Troi
                          has a headache. Just why the Enterprise
                          is crawling with Imps and Cacodemons,
                          no-one knows. They should be aliens
                          with latex on their foreheads and noses,
                          but alas, we make do.
                          
                          You are Ensign Wesley Crusher - your
                          mother was on planet leave when _strange_
                          things started to happen. Data got a life,
                          Lwaxana became a nun, the security team
                          came back from planetside intact, Worf
                          came out of the closet, Riker _didn't_
                          scam on some babe and Tasha Yar came back
                          from the dead ... again. Ya-know, it's the
                          little things that give it away. It's
                          gonna be a tough day.

                          Set phasers to rotisserie and report to
                          transporter room three on the double. You
                          must join your mum before _you_ get toasted
                          and the Enterprise gets a parking ticket.

                          Just look out for Q in a very special guest
                          appearance in engineering!
