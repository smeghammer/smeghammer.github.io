Description             : Two "SUPER" Deathmatch levels
			  SUPER22.WAD - Great for 2 players, untested with 
			      > 2 You can really rack up the frags and have
			      a good time doing it!  When we quit one
			      particular session, I had 80 Frags and my
			      opponent had about 40.
			      Go look at the CYBERDEMON...it can't hurt
			      you until the barrels are blown up.                                              
			      Kill the CYBERDEMON together, or leave 
			      it out there to make things interesting.
			   SUPER33.WAD - Probably better with > 2 players 
			      although we had a pretty good time with two.  
			      Not as heavily playtested as SUPER22.  

Additional Credits to   : My wife, Roxanne and her brother Steve Clancy

			 : id Software, for creating DOOM, Colin Reed for 
			   BSP, Matt Fell for the DOOM Specs, and Raphael 
			   Quinet and Brendon J. Wyber for DEU.

Known Bugs                      : None that we could find in testing.
				  For future reference, I NEVER post a level
				  if I've found even the smallest of bugs and 
				  I get really PISSED off at people who do!  
				  I can understand mis-aligned textures, but 
				  there is NO EXCUSE for the "hall of 
				  mirrors" effect anywhere in a posted PWAD.  
				  You probably spent some long-distance $ 
				  d/ling this file so you deserve a quality 
				  level.  IF YOU FIND ANY BUGS IN ONE OF MY 
				  PWADS, FLAME THE #&@% OUT OF ME VIA CIS OR 
				  EMAIL.
