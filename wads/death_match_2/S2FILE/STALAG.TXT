STALAG.WAD E1M1
---------------

This is my third WAD file and I think my last one too. The idea came 
from my friend Jose Bono who wanted a large place to run in. Well 
I think I over did it. It is thought as a perfect Deathmatch site to
play in. But creating it was ticket out of the game with my friends.
There is one small problem. I have not placed as many THINGS as I would
have like to. After spending around 20 hours building it, I was not
in the mood to put things all over the place. I don't mind building sectors  
and triggers, but placing things is my worst nightmare. If you like it just 
drop me a line with any sugestion or comment.   


I wish to thank:

Jose Bono (70630,121) for the idea of creating a large killing zone
and beta testing it.

Tomas Chan (tchan@b107.eunet.es) for beta testing it and setting the record
par time (8 Min).

Sebastian Kirke in letting me know how to solve some mirroring problems.


I hope you enjoy it.
