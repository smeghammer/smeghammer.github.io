Description             : A single room map, with all of the weapons,
                          and tons of ammo, and a whole horde of monsters.  
                          A pretty big challenge for a player to
                          finish (the beginning is pretty rough) in a 
                          single-player game, but I can do it, so you  
                          should be able to as well! =O).  I've never tried
                          it with > 2 players...  It's kind
                          slow with multiple players until you kill off
                          most of the monsters, and then the speed improves
                          (this is on 486-66 Mhz machines with 128Kb cache)
                          The theme: The world's longest marble staircase!

                          To play this wad file, run:
                          doom -file stairwar.wad

                          If you can't solve the level, I've included a demo
                          of me solving it (stairwar.lmp).  Only look at it
                          as a last resort, it spoiles everything!
                          To play the demo, run:
                          doom -playdemo stairwar -file stairwar.wad

Additional Credits to   : Kenneth S. Forte, who wrote the ULTIMA.WAD file
                          which I base mine on (I couldn't get DEU to work
                          without crashing starting from scratch), although
                          this level barely resembles his level.
                          To the creators of DOOM and DEU - may all of you
                          be enshrined as gods in the years to come!

* Construction *

Base                    : Severely Modified E2M1 - ULTIMA.WAD
Editor(s) used          : DEU 5.21
Build Time:		: About 30 hours (15 of those hours to 
                          learn DEU).  About 40 % of the time
                          spent on making the staircase.
Known Bugs              : We don't need no steenking texture 
                          alignment!  Hall-Of-Mirrors effect
                          when standing at the top of the stairs.
                          Totally sloppily constructed WAD.

Authors MAY use this level as a base to build additional
levels.  However, I don't recommend it!  I was learning, so there
is no logic to most of the sectors, or any consistency. Use 
ULTIMA.WAD to build off of instead, it's much more clean.

You MAY distribute this WAD, provided you include this file, with
no modifications.  You may distribute this file in any electronic
format (BBS, Diskette, CD, etc) as long as you include this file
