Description :

            This level consists of four rooms connected with some dark
            hallways.  The lighted areas tend to be quite bright, and the 
            dark areas are pitch black.  This was done to facillitate
            ambushes.  When you begin, and each time you die, you will 
            have 50 rockets, 50 shotgun shells, and the blue armor.  What
            you will not have is the weapons to use them.  The weapons are 
            placed in the various rooms, and the more destructive the weapon, the
            more difficult it is to reach.  There's even a plasma rifle for
            the daring.  There's only a few monsters, and I recomend using
            the respawn option because it keeps you from sitting in one
            place forever.  Not to mention it keeps a few shotguns laying
            around which can be very handy.

            If you have any trouble finding all the weapons watch the
            demo.
