		HELP!!! Can someone help me.... 

	I'll be trying to fix the huge bug this wad has, but i haven't been
able to solve the problem..
	The thing is that, from outside the castle, there are some strange 
mirrors if you look to the castle, but i dunno... 

	Can someone help me, correcting the fail and uploading a new version
to infant2?? I'll really appreciate it, because i spent some days on finding
out what the hell was wrong, but i couldn't make it....

		Please mail me to a910426@zipi.fi.upm.es if you find the bug
and have solved it.... thanx in advance
