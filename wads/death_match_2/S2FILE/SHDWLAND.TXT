Description             : This is a brick and steel arena with
                          special lighting.  It's possible to get
                          lost when you have to in the shadows.
                          Lots of atmosphere.  I've included all
                          weapons except the BFG, lots of ammo,
                          and enough health to make it worth 
                          while to escape a losing firefight.
