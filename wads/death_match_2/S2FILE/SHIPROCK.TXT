Description             : This level is a replica of the
                          Rose Pauson residence (Shiprock)
                          designed by Frank Lloyd Wright.
                          Both floors are accessible, connected
                          by an almost invisible mechanism.
                          To access all parts of this level,
                          you must use the accompanying
                          DeHackEd patch.
                          
                          Deathmatch starts, weapons & an exit
                          are included for people who want to
                          play war games inside a work of art.
                          Otherwise, it is set up only for a
                          one-person walk-through.

Additional Credits to   : My father for the idea and the
                          floorplan; Frank Lloyd Wright; the
                          authors of all the editors I used;

Editor(s) used          : DEU, BSP, DeHackEd
Known Bugs              : Because the DeHackEd patch lowers the
                          player width, it may be possible for
                          player's graphic to be seen on the
                          other side of a wall.  If you have
                          this problem, let me know.
