Misc. Author Info       : 5th year grad student with an itchy trigger finger! 

Description             : This is not intended to be a continuation or sequel to
			  Satan's Lair, but rather, its more of an add-on to the 
			  previous level.  It has more rooms, some very 
			  difficult to find secret rooms, and more monsters than
			  you can shake a chainsaw at!  And it's made for 
			  Doom ][.  If you liked the first one, you'll love this
			  one.

Additional Credits to   : iD Software, the fine people who made RMB, Wad1to2,
			  Deu, and my cousin Jon Kung for working out the
			  bugs.
