Misc. Author Info       : A doomer since Dec 10th, I can usually be found 
                          on the irc channel #doom.

Description             : For those who have used swmusfx2 or swmusfx3,
                          this contains some new sounds that correspond
                          to the various graphics patches that have been
                          released.  For the Imperial Guard graphics 
                          replacements, I had trouble finding sounds so I
                          just inserted a blank VOC. ;)  They don't strike
                          me as the type to say much anyway. ;)  I also
                          took some of the music from Tie Fighter (Thanks
                          for the help with that Force!) and replaced 10
                          levels with music from the game.  Anyway, I hope
                          you enjoy the new sounds and music!
