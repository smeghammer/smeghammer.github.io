Misc. Author Info     : Creating this WAD was as much fun as playing it.
			After downloading many WADS for deathmatches I
			felt that I should make a WAD that my friends
			and I would like to play, and also to contribute
			to the Doom community at large. Please, if you like
			this WAD (or not), send me feedback so that in the 
			future I can make even better levels.

Major Credits to      : Id Software (Doom is bound for the Hall of Fame)
			Ben Morris for writing DCK v2.0 (A great editor).

Additional Credits to : My Testing Team and victims: Virgil Itliong,
			Keith Johnston, and Brian Nelson. Our many hours
			of 2, 3 and 4 player deathmatches in this level and
			their great comments and suggestions have improved
			this level dramatically over its early incarnations.

Description:

 - Designed for Doom II deathmatch. ( -altdeath highly recommended )

 - This level's venue is a European mansion several hundred years old.
   There is a noticeable lack of technology other than the weapons, 
   they are all included. There are no teleporters and only one lift, which
   is in the center of the courtyard. I tried to give this level the look
   and feel of a real place. The size of the WAD is due to the great amount
   of detail I put in each room. (ie. fireplaces, furniture etc.) and not
   because its big in area. In fact it's only slightly bigger in area than
   Ledges1.

 - This level was inspired by the Ledges series in that there is a central 
   courtyard surrounded by a series of rooms and walkways.

 - I tried to satisfy the two different types of deathmatch playing styles.
   There are several snipe points for those who like to wait in ambush 
   (some of which are accessible only through secret doors), and open areas
   (ie. the courtyard and east side of the map outside the dining hall) 
   for those who like wide open frag-o-ramas.

 - There are 8 deathmatch starts. All starts are in rooms which have one
   exit which is only opened from the inside. Each start position has a
   single pump action shotgun, a box of shells and a backpack. This was
   done by a suggestion one of my testers made to make all the starts
   fair, and to also eliminate materializing in front of another player
   after being killed, which usually gave somebody an easy frag. After all
   who wants hollow victories!

 - All rooms (other than the start rooms) have multiple exits. This way
   it's hard to be trapped in a room without an avenue of escape if needed.

 - This level has been throughly tested in 2, 3 and 4 player deathmatches.
   In 4 player deathmatches we have averaged 1 kill every 20 seconds. In
   one testing (testing? hee hee) run we had, we played a 4 player
   deathmatch for 1.5 hours and totaled over 350 kills. Since we play
   4 player deathmatches I designed this level for that. However, 2 player
   deathmatches will be OK if you seek and destroy instead of waiting in
   ambush.

 - There should be more than enough ammo if using -altdeath (especially
   since you most likely won't live long enough to use it all)
