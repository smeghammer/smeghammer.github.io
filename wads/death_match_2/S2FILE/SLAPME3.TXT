Description            : This is an updated version of slapme2 for Doom II.
                         It's primarily designed for deathmatch set around
                         a castle courtyard, but has some beasties added
                         for solo or co-op play (mostly just to let you know
                         where the other player is).  There are lots of good
                         sniper spots which usually have sniper spots
                         overlooking them also... To quote Andrew Hulme ...
                         "Give your mates a right good slapping with this
                         wad."

Other: If you pass this to a buddy for a Deathmatch slugfest you may not 
want to let them know (at first) that the Megasphere on the central 
pillar is unreachable.  I've already had several people bashing their 
brains in a vain attempt to get to it... (GRIN)  Just make sure you give 
them the complete slapme3.zip file after you're done with them.

We are all creatures of the shadows in our hearts, I'm just proud of it.
