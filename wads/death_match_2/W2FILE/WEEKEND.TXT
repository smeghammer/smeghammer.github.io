Description             : DOOM ][ DEATHMATCH WAD
                          After playing many, good Deathmatch PWADS, and building
                          a couple, I decided to build a fast, high-frag DeathMatch 
                          wad. It has a central, open 'arena' to battle in with
                          surrounding passageways, a couple of dark shortcuts and 
                          NO shortage of weapons or ammo. You will amass MANY,
                          MANY frags here!!!!!
                        
Instructions            : Put WEEKEND.WAD in your DOOM2 directory, change to that
                          directory and type "doom2 -file weekend.wad -warp 1 -skill <#>"
                          
Disclaimer              : I assume no responsibility for anything of any sort,
                          in any way, shape, or form--now, then, henceforeward 
                          in this life (or the next several) for any screw-ups
                          or even minor inconveniences this PWAD causes you,
                          your family, your relatives, friends, ancestors,
                          associates, employers, pets, neighbors, lovers,
                          congressional representatives, nor any other person--
                          living, dead, or undead -- that you have or will ever
                          have any contact with in even the slightest form.
                          This PWAD has been tested and tested and tested, so
                          it shouldn't mess with your computer or anything else
                          remotely associated with it.  But if it DOES, then
                          that's just TUFF SHIT! Don't even come lookin' for me.
                          It must be something YOU did.
