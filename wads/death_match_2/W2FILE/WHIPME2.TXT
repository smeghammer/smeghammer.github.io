Description             : This is a DooM II update of my fourth wad whip_me. It's a small deathmatch only level, ideal for 2 players, very fast and furious. Another all time classic I'm sure.

Additional Credits to   : Adam Gilchrist and Andy Banks for playtesting.

Additional Info		: Weapons are situated to make you a sitting target so move fast. You can run but you can't hide ... or can you?
