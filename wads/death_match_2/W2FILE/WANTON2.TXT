Hi all, this is an improved version of the original, and quite
acclaimed pwad, WANTON. I've taken all the suggestions from the
original post (wanton was actually one of the first full levels
created for doom) and tried to implement them to make a better pwad. 
This version, WANTON2.WAD is for registered DOOM II.

Enjoy!

Short Description       : Wanton is a large level split into four
        		  trianglular sections and a large middle 
			  arena. This level is a slugfest! I have 
			  gone to great extents to make it a good
			  deathmatch level as well as a good single
			  player level.

Description		: Take on the hellish creatures of doom on 
			  their own turf! First, you will face flying
			  skulls on a precarious path in their dark
			  and fiery home (with teleporters should you 
			  accidently slip "ooops"). Then it's off to
			  the playground of the cacos a place of great
                          heights and quite a bit of slime. Should you
			  be lucky enough to survive that, you will be
			  plunged into the blood maze of the demons. A
			  rather disgusting place where even the walls
			  bleed and most likely so will your knuckles.
			  You will find very little ammo here, bezerk
			  is your only friend, and the return trip is
			  even worse. Finally, you will be roasted in
			  the cave of the barons and that's still not
			  the end. To reach the exit you will return
			  to the arena, which should be filled with
			  corpses already, and cower in front of the
			  final and the largest (quite possibly) horde
			  of hell spawn ever assembled. This level is 
			  WANTON.
