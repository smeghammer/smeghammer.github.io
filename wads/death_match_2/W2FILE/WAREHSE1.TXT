Title                   : Where?  The Warehouse!  
Filename                : WAREHSE1.WAD
Author                  : Jeff Gerstmann
Email Address           : jgerstma@nermal.santarosa.edu
Misc. Author Info       : I have hair.  I have never broken a bone.
                          This is my first WAD.  I like eating meat. 
Description             : This level just screams 4-player deathmatch.
                          Since the maze is so big, you may want to use
                          respawn just to give yourself something to do
                          while looking for the others.  I have a theme
                          in mind, so this may become part of a 9 level
                          episode.  But then again, everybody says that.
