FILENAME: WOODY.WAD
LEVEL(S) REPLACED: Map 1
NEW GRAPHICS: NO
NEW SOUNDS: NO

COMMENTS: This is a fairly difficult .WAD file.  It took me about 3 weeks
to make.  I think you'll like it.  It has the CyberDemon, Spider Boss, and
The Final Enemy.  It also has every gun EXCEPT BFG 9000.  It is pretty good
for deathmatch, although I made it with CooP in mind.
