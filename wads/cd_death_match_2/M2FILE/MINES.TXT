     Imagine you come across a mine shaft.  A well guarded mine shaft at that.
Are you brave enough to venture in?  Lots of hidden doors, traps, and
teleports.
     
     Now for some detail about this level.  This level was created using 
Doom Editor - The Real Thing version 2.60 beta 2.  (DE_260B2.ZIP) by 
Geoff Allan.  I am anxiously waiting for the next beta or final release of 
this editor.  If you find it, I'd apreciate a copy.

     This level replaces E1M1 for the registered version of DOOM.  The only
known bug is that it errors out during Multiplayer mode.  It works fine for
single player.  If you have any suggestions about this problem, please let me
know.  This level also supports difficulty levels.  If you are really insane,
try level 4.

     I am releasing this level into Public Domain and do not expect any form
of payment for it.  Enjoy it!  I worked on it for about a month and tested it
with a group of friends.

     As for legalities, you are free to modify and distribute as you wish.  I
just ask that you distribute it with this text file so that I can receive some
small level of credit for it and even possibly get some mail in the process.
I am not responsible for any damage it might do to your system (after all, it's
only a WAD patch file).

     You run this level simply by typing: 

     DOOM -FILE MINES.WAD

     BIG HINT:  You need both keys to get out of this level, and they aren't
                easy to find!

                                  GOOD LUCK!
