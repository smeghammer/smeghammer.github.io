Description             : This is my second WAD, hence the catchy title.
                          It's smaller than I would have liked, but most of
                          the construction was done in DEU 5 and I started
                          running out of RAM. It's subsequently been 
                          tidied-up in V5.2.
                          I've tried to set it up as an alternative to E1M1
                          that can be played through, i.e. you won't start
                          E1M2 with any advantages over the original in terms
                          of usable weapons etc.
