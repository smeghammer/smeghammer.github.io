Description

This is kinda a new idea for a level. It is meant solely for 
2 player cooperative play. The general idea of the level is 
that there are actually two levels in one here. Things that 
one player does on there side of the level effect the opposite
player's side of the level. Each player must gather up a key
on their side of the level in order for the level to be 
completed. This makes single player play of the level impossible
and play testing of the level difficult. Anyway, I hope that
The bugs in the level have been worked out. I made this level
because I was getting bored with playing deathmatch, and my
friends have stopped wanting to play against me. I thot that
this may be an interesting alternative to killing each other.
