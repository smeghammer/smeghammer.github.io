This is a "Compound Group" of wads.
Just run "doom -file doompl4.wad"
This will give you a ALL NEW,  full 8 map episode 1 Doom!
This will ONLY WORK WITH REG. VERSION !!!
I am more of a player than a builder so I put these together
for the rest of us. I used DEU5 to "Group" these hits.
Thanks to the DEU authors and to the authors of these great wads!!
The NEW Episode in order of map and Complexity is .....
I didn't build 'em I just wraped 'em up. Haven't finished them either
so let's all have some fun and let the Coder/builders have some time.
Great job to all of you!
