WASTELAND: DEAD BASE (version 1.0) (position E2L1)


INTRODUCTION

It had been four hours since Lt. Morrison left the starship and still the
receiver's screen stayed blank. Maj. Barowsky, sitting in front of the
communication terminal, pressed some keys and called the mother ship.

``Maj. Barowsky reporting. Four hours ago Lt. Morrison teleported to
the planetary surface, near the Prometeus Base. I haven't yet received
any transmission from him nor from the base.''

``Gen. Vitesse here, you are ordered to take all the weapons on board
and descend to the surface. Investigate the base and locate the causes
of the loss of transmission. Should you encounter any hostile presence
you should track its origin and eliminate it.''

``I'm sorry, sir, but Lt. Morrison left equipped with all the high-power
energy weapons, including the latest BFG 9000 gun. The only weapons
on board are some archaic shotgun and chaingun....''

``We all know your battle skills are far superior to those of Lt. Morrison,
I have no doubt you are the best soldier to deal with whatever lies
in the Prometeus Base. Your orders are to proceed to the command center,
which is a large square building located at the eastern end of the base and
enter through the main door which is on the western wall.
Should anyone down there be still alive the command center is the place
where he will stay. Gather as much information as you can,
eliminate hostiles and re-estabilish transmissions. Good Luck!''

`Oh fuck!' Maj. Barowsky thought.
`Well, someone will have to fix it sooner or later. I'll make sure
that whatever took control of the base will regret this.' he said
equipping himself with a megaarmor and several weapons. `Good,
there is also a rocket launcher.....'
Then, looking again at the base diagram, he bravely stepped into
the teleporter......


WELCOME!

Welcome to the first mission in the Wasteland series: Dead Base.
In this mission you play the role of Maj. Barowsky as he cleans
the lost Prometeus Base from alien creatures and locates the
information which will eventually allow him to proceed towards
the origin of all the evil.

Misc. Author Info       :

Description:
the setting is open-field/city-like, bright light, many buildings,
high demand of processing power.

This is my first attempt at creating WAD files for DOOM.
The creation of this WAD was made possible by the two great programs
called DEU 5.1 and BSP 1.1.
In this WAD I made my attempt at the creation of multi-floor buildings
using teleporters along staircases. The only 'true' teleporter is the
one in the beginning, all subsequent teleport effects should be ignored
(if you don't look at the map too often the illusion of multi-floor
is better....) The jammed door that you will find helps creating the
effect of two separate floors.
I also tried to concentrate in creating a realistic (and also playable)
lighting conditions, I wanted to have buildings cast shadows, but that
would require more hours of sector hacking and many more 2-sided LineDefs
which would slow down the game a lot, so I dropped the idea.
As for the difficulty, this is an average level, the experienced player
will have no problem to complete it.

EPILOGUE

Maj. Barowsky, his face covered with sweat and blood, climbed up the
red mountain, following the smell of the evil which had turned the
Prometeus Base into a graveyard. After a few minutes he came to a cave,
the trail was clear, this was the source of the devastation.
Firmly holding his fully loaded Plasma Gun he entered the dark mouth
of the cave, ready to face everything that might lurk inside.
The tunnel proceeded upwards, towards a large room lit by flaming
torches, he leapt forward and......

......entered the second mission of the Wasteland series: Mountain of Fire.
