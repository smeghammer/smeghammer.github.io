Description             : This is a NEW DEATHMATCH Only Level for Doom ][
                          The first level for D][ was ok for 2 player DM
			  but I found the rest were either too big or had too
			  many powerful items in them.. This level has NO mega
			  or supercharge spheres. ALL weapons are present.

Additional Credits to   : VT102 (on IRC) for 1DEU2 (the modified Doom ][ editor
			  ID for Doom ][ and Doom. Nabob for the great blend
			  of Coffee (Milano Espresso) 8-)
			  Jens Hykkelbjerg for the Beta of RMB13 so I could 
			  build a Reject Map for Doom ][ PWADS.

Additional Notes        : As stated above, it was designed primarily for
                          deathmatch.  It really wouldn't be that fun
                          in single user mode, and could probably be 
                          completed in under 10 secs.. The Exit is behind you!

                          Please send me any comments or suggestions for 
                          improvement.
