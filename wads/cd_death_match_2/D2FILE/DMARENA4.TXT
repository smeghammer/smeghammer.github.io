Misc. Author Info       : Special thanks go to the guys at All-City
			  Software and Computers for helping test
			  this .wad. 

Description             : This level is centered around a large arena  
			  with four runways to other rooms/weapons. There
			  are four safe starting points and four less safe  
			  starting points. All the weapons are there but 
			  all have a certain degree of consequence.   
			  The idea was that you would need to visit every 
			  area of the level, but going from place to place 
			  you would all meet up in the arena. The level is  
			  best played with four players but is just as fun 
			  with two. 

Org Description         : This level replaces Map 01.  I didn't bother with
			  setting skill levels because no one plays  
			  deathmatch with monsters, right?!  But I did make 
			  it so that 4 player co-op is challenging. 
			  And of course everyone playes with -altdeath!

Additional Credits to   : Myself cause I made the level!
