Description             : This is a deathmatch only WAD.
                          I started it on DOOM 1 but when DOOM 2
                          came out I converted it.  This is my
                          first WAD so it's not that pretty.

Additional Credits to   : id Software, the authors of DEU and
                          WADED, and the guy who made HITMEINF.WAD
