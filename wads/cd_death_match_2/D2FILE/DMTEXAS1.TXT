Misc. Author Info       : This is my 6th WAD file. This is my design, my wife 
                          didn't help design this one. Her's is coming next.

Description             : A large, tough floor. Takes me 25 minutes to 
                          complete without cheating. Thought about making the 
                          map look like the state of Texas, but gave up on 
                          that, kept the name, though. Revised to support 
                          deathmatches.

Additional Credits to   : id for DOOM. Geoff Allan for making DoomED-The Real 
                          Thing. My wife,Kathy, for play testing the floor.
