Doom II war- a great deathmatch level.
to play this level type doom2 -file dm2war.wad (as if you didn't know)
When you play this level over the modem (sersetup doesn't work, you need 
something like ser5) I beg you to use -altdeath . It makes all the ammo and 
health come back 30 seconds after it's taken, and deathmatch is so much 
better with it.When you play this level on single play,there isn't much health
or ammo, but don't worry, it all appears over the modem (or over a network)
And in case you can't figure out how to beat the level, I have enclosed a demo
on how to do that. To play the demo, type: 
Doom2 -file dm2war.wad -playdemo dm2demo .This level should not be played with
cooperative, because you can't even beat it over the modem! (This pwad is 
episode 1) To write to me about dm2war.wad, email me at:
