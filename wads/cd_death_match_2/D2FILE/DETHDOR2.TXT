Description             : This great DEATHMATCH level is some small 
                          rooms seperated by some doors. There are nooks
                          in the side for weapons and hiding spots.
                          There is a cool room that is all red and
                          there is an AWESOME surprise in there. Only 1 mon-
                          ster, so you can set to respawn.
                          All weps except BFG and doom1 shotgun.
