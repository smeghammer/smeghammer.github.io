Title                 : Deathtrap  
Filename              : DTHTRAP.WAD
Author                : David L. Farrington
Email Address         : CIS: 74242,1270
Misc. Author Info     : Cromwell, CT

Description            : I think the name says it all. Its playable but 
			tough. This was an experiment in building a simple 
			level that would be dangerous and make the most of a 
			player's skills. It may be easier to play 
			cooperatively, and deathmatch will be deadly. 
			Warning! The monsters have free travel and may come 
			through the wallsat you! Tons of ammo included.

			Please E-Mail me with your comments on CIS. Your 
			comments go a long toward improving my 'work'.

Additional Credits    : Raphael Quinet and Brendon J Wyber for the DEU editor
			Colin Reed for the BSP utility
			John Warren for the idea
			Gary M Thomas for being the play tester
			and of course, those great people at id, without 
			which we would not have the pleasure to play DOOM.
			I would like to thank those great people on CIS for 
			their help and inspirations.

Instructions          : Put DTHTRAP.WAD and DTHTRAP.BAT in your DOOM 
			directory, then run the batch file.  This takes you 
			right into it, skiping the intro stuff, chooses 
			"Ultraviolent" skill, and jumps right into the level.  
			Modify the batch file with -skill # as you please. 
			Otherwise, choose New Game, Shores of Hell, and the 
			skill level you prefer and play thru as normal.

Disclaimer            : I assume no responsibility for anything of any sort 
			in any way, shape, or form, now, then, henceforeward 
			for any problems or even minor inconveniences this 
			PWAD causes you or anyone else. This PWAD has been 
			tested ad infinitum, so it should not mess with your 
			computer or anything else remotely associated with it. 
			If you have problems with this PWAD, please don't use 
			it.
