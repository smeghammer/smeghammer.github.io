JUST BOUGHT DOOM II AND ALL I CAN SAY IS "WOW!!!!!"

Id outdid themselves!  Go out and get it today!  If you already
have a pirate copy, be real.  Dump it and pay for it so that 
Id can continue to bring out kick-ass games like DOOM II!  If
you insist on being a slacker asshole and not paying for the
game, here's wishing you a speedy and final hard drive crash!

                          replacement episodes for Wolfenstein 3D
                          (shareware version).  Also DOOM GOLD I,
                          DOOM GOLD II, DOOM GOLD II BRIGHT, &
                          DOOM GOLD II LITE, as well as E-13SND1,2
                          and DOOM GOLD III.

Description             : Sound and (some) graphics replacement
                          PWAD for commercial DOOM II - Hell On Earth
                          

Notes                   : NOTE:  This WAD is designed to "turn on the
                                 the lights" in DOOM II.  For those of
                                 you who wish to keep the mystery of
                                 darkened rooms but still wish to take
                                 advantage of DOOM GOLD IV sounds, please
                                 download DMGOLD_IV.ZIP
                          
                          This WAD was specially created for use with
                          DOOM II  This is the first *LEGAL* WAD I know
                          of that was built with DOOM II in mind.
                         
                          It will take advantage of the DOOM2.WAD structure
                          and change a few sounds that were in the original
                          DOOM for the better, WITHOUT losing the nifty
                          new sounds Id put in the new version.

                          Try playing DOOM II without this PWAD included.
                          Then, try it with the PWAD.  I think you'll
                          agree the game is much enhanced with the 
                          addition of this WAD!!!!!

                          If you still have the older commercial version
                          of DOOM and want to enhance the sounds, you
                          can find a copy of DOOM GOLD III on a BBS or
                          ftp site near you.
