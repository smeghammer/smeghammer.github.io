Description             : Small d-match only wad made to avoid camping.  Based upon the 
			Destruction Comes wad.  Be careful mouse players!  The spiral 
			staircase has a rocket on top.  I have been fragged multiple times
			by a lowly keyboard player because of it.  Learn to be a mouse +
			keyboard player.  :-)  Hope you enjoy this newest and last revision
			of the Destruction Comes DEATHMATCH wad.

Other:  I have tried to build a good d-match wad and I have tested it as much as possible 
	  for problems with camping, textures,etc..  All I ask is that any bugs or suggestions
	  be sent to me at trm2000@osuunx.ucc.okstate.edu.  Also I ask that some guys who
	  are GOOD players send me a lmp of their deathmatch(s) with my wad so I can 
	  enjoy it in my home.  Thanks.
