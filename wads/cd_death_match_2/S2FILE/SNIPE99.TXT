Misc. Author Info               : I'm SYSADMIN and SYSPGMR for supercomputing
                                  with no time on my hands, but make time for
                                  the most important thing: DOOM!

Description                     : This level was originally a small deathmatch
                                  concept, but needed some additions to improve
                                  playability. This level is moderate in size
                                  and has been designed for 2 Player Deathmatch.
                                  It also plays well as a one player episode.
                                  There are a few hidden doors, but they should
                                  be easy to spot. Two teleporters. A hidden exit,
                                  but it is revealed fairly easily. Monsters are
                                  copious in UV, and there is a spiderdemon.
                                  Not too tough to get though, because of the
                                  location. View the .lmp to see basically the
                                  entire level in UV. (Apologize for my performance
                                  as I only had the keyboard at the time)
