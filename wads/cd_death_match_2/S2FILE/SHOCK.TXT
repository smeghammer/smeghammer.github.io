Misc. Author Info       : <ack!>

Description             : Well, this is my first attempt at making a
                          scratch level for Doom. Let me begin by saying
                          all flames to /dev/null. <g>

                          My goal was simply to familiarize myself with
                          the basic features that DEU 5.0 afforded. And
                          to this end, I have designed a simple 23
                          sector map suitable for two-player
                          deathmatches.

                          This level is not very good for solo or co-op
                          play. No trick or traps, no moving objects, no
                          transporters. But I did drop a few monsters in
                          just to make it interesting.
