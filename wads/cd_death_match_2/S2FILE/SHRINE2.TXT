Description:             You begin right next door to hell.  in a twisted
                         chamber used by hell spawn as a portal to the 
                         human realms.

                         You venture beyond the portal to find... the Shrine.
                         The shrine is a large complex that pays tribute to
                         the hell spawn.  Some what of a cross between an art
                         museum and a mausoleum.

                         The tourists and guardians are a little bit hostile.

                         Can you survive?

                         Some advice, you may get the rocket launcher early,
                         SAVE IT FOR WHEN YOU REALLY NEED IT!
