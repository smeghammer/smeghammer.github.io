Description             	: This is an updated version of slapme for Doom II. It's a deathmatch only WAD set around a castle coourtyard type thing. There are lots of good sniper points and look out for the secret passages for the extra bonuses, the slimey walls inside give them away. Give your mates a right good slapping with this wad.

Additional Credits to   	: Adam Gilchrist and Andy Banks for playtesting, when they should have been working. Ta to all the folks who have written the various editors. ID software are owed a mention cos Doom II is the dog's.
