               The Innocent Crew proudly presents:

                  -=[ Slaughter Until Death ]=-

                a completely new episode for DOOM
*****************************************************************

      First we want to thank ID for their great game DOOM.

      Then, we want to thank all these cool guys, who are
    developing utilities for DOOM, such as DEU or DMIMAGE...

   At the beginning we wanted to create two episodes, but it
   takes too long to make good levels, so we decided to pack
             it into one, with additional graphics.
   There are a few new walls and we changed the music of the
                    levels - no new music.
   We also wanted to change some floors or ceilings, but we
    had many problems getting them into DOOM as PWADs...!?
       Always they break the game with an error-message:

           W_CacheLumpNum: [big number] >= numlumps

                      Whatever that mean...

      This episode is like the second original episode of
   DOOM, maybe a bit harder. It is fully Multi-Player capable
      and contains additional things only for Multi-Play.
  It's also tested with 2 players - so there are no dead ends.

                     Slaughter Until Death:

                     E2M1: Flying Guts
                     E2M2: Mysterious Halls
                     E2M3: The Blazed
                     E2M4: Death Pain
                     E2M5: Mutilated Corpses
                     E2M6: Damned Bastards
                     E2M7: Dehumanization
                     E2M8: Baphomets Throne
                     E2M9: Arena Of Punishment

     Level 1,3,7,8,9 and additional graphics by Grindcrusher
                      Level 2,4,5,6 by Panza

    There are also 3 single player demos in our big WAD-File.

    We spend much time to create this, so please respond any
                     error, idea or whatever...

                            Have fun!
