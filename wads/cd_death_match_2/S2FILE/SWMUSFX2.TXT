                       STAR WARS DOOM! version 2
                       ---------------

        This rather quick version 2 (I released version 1 around 4 hours ago 
  ;)) came from some quick responses to my posting in alt.games.doom.  I 
  managed to scrape up some more Star Wars music (With a special thanks
  going out to Chad Anson for info on the files!) so now each mission has
  different music, except the music for e1m1 is the same as the music for
  e2m1 etc.  The music is repeated in each episode but there is now the
  addition of music at the end of episodes as well as in between missions.
  Of course, there is still the PWAD full of Star Wars sounds.  Anyway,
  have fun and I think I'll delete swmusfx.zip when I can. ;)
