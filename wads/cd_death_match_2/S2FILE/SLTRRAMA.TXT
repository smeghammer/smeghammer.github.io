Description             : You finally get a much needed R&R, after months of
                          'cleaning up' on Mars.  A friend of yours suggested
                          an interesting site on Rigel V, an ancient alien
                          city.  As you enter the system you attempt contact
                          for permission to land, but theres no response. 
                          You set the coords for landing thinking 'maybe 
                          theres interference, after all I'm still not in 
                          orbit'.  As you descend you still get static, you
                          begin to wonder...
                                The landing pad is empty and theres no sign 
                          of life!  Somethings definately wrong!  No civilian
                          base lets anyone land for free!  Just as you touch
                          down you see an awful familiar sight, cacodemons!
                          You see the plasma balls coming at your ship, and 
                          you panic.  The first thought is if they hit the
                          fuel you're history!  Into the teleporter you go, 
                          not knowiing where you'll end up, there's no time 
                          to be picky...
                                As you rematerialize elsewhere, you hear your
                          ship explode.  The blast nearly deafens you, typical
                          of a warp core breach.  You can only assume the
                          landing pad is now the newest crater on this world.
                          Now there's no way back, and you've been teleported
                          into a court with possessed troops who are looking
                          for new targets...

                          the wonderful access they've given me, without
