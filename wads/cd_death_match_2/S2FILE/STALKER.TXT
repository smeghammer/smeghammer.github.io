* All difficulty settings from "Hurt me plenty" down have no
  monsters.  "Ultra-Violence" and "Nightmare" have lots of 
  monsters.  So, it's possible to play in single-player and
  cooperative modes, but I can't imagine that it's any fun.

* Comments *

As the name suggests, the idea was to have to stalk your opponent,
instead of just being dropped into a big pit with guns a-blazing.
I'm still trying to hit on what the right mixture is for a 
deathmatch level, and I'd like to hear any suggestions.  Should
the level be bigger or smaller?  More or less monsters?  More
wide open spaces or more crawl spaces?

By the way, the niches with the danger symbol inside DO have a
purpose, in case you don't notice at first.
