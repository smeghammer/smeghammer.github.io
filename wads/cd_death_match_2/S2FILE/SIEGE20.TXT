Description             : A HUGE improvement over Siege 1.0
                          Your mission, whether or not you 
                          choose to accept it, is to infiltrate
                          the castle and maintain control of it.
                          Intelligence suggests a strong outside
                          contingent, but no significant defense
                          on the inside.  Your main obstacle will
                          be rival infiltrators...
                          You will NOT be given reinforcements.
                          Good luck.  Good-bye.
