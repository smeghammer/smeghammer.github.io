Description             : A 4 player Deathmatch for Doom II, works very well
                          for 2 players also. The dark bowels of Hell is the setting 
			  for this breathtaking DeathMatch for Doom II. Twin elevators
			  provide access to Hell, where you will find most of the 
			  weaponry in the game. All weapons are available in_hell. There are 
			  many sniper positions overlooking popular areas, but beware, there 
			  are not many safe spots in_hell. Also watch out for univited riders
 			  that drop in on the elevators. Disembark quickly from the elevator 
			  or your opponent may drag you back down, and bury you in_hell. 
			  The Lava Room will have the bulk of the available ammo, look 
			  to the surface for any serious healing(except in -skill 4 or 5). 
			  However if you brave the Lava Troughs you can scrounge up enough 
			  health to possibly outlast the creatures in_hell. The skill levels 
			  are implemented, if you are playing DeathMatch and you would 
			  like more weapons and ammo, try adding -skill 4 or 5 to your command 
			  line. In single player simply go to Hell (hehehe), retrieve the 
			  red skullkey, and come back to the surface alive. In single and 
			  cooperative, you may not even see the BFG until you have killed 
			  everything. If you are skilled you can get the skullkey and the BFG 
		          to make good your escape from Hell. Remember the skill levels are 
			  implemented. Cooperative has extra monsters that are only in 
			  multi-play(-skill 4 or 5). You and your buddies should make 
			  short work of the creatures in_hell.
			  I consider the Lava Room a work of art. Hope you enjoy this WAD !

Recommendations         : -altdeath , -nomonsters, -skill 4 or 5 (if more ammo/weapons are 
			: and of course we always play -turbo 200 :)                  desired)
