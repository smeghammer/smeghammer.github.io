ABOUT THE FILE:

             This is a DOOM level created using DoomEd - The Real Thing by
             Geoff Allan. It is a SINGLE player level. This is one of the 
             toughest levels that I have created. It is the first in a
             series of Imp's challenges. It took myself and the Beta testers
             quite a few hours to complete this level. Now, we can complete
             the level in about six minutes. Comments on this level are welcome
             and I can be reached via Compuserve at address 73131,1037.
             I hope you enjoy this one. It is a real challenge.
