Description             : `Acorn Hardas' rides again - Following on from my
                          experiences with `The Imp Zone' and the comments
                          I received, here's the sequel.
                          It seems the favourite part of Imp Zone was the
                          Turkey Shoot off the pseudo bridge.  That was
                          developed further in IZ2.  Just look out when you
                          get to looking down on the Green Nuke Pit where you
                          started from, it gets VERY hot in Ultra Violent
                          Mode, don't be in too much of a rush to be
                          confrontational, you must use your wits and take
                          them by the `back door' Paul wanted some difficult
                          secrets, I accomodated him with one `corker', if
                          you can't get 3 x 100% watch the DEMO, it shows
                          you most of the secrets.
                        
                          Most of all, I just hope it gives a few people as
                          much pleasure playing it as it gave me to construct.
                          JUST HAVE FUN but be careful out there!

                          find a reason and so changed the Office Wall
                          Texture, I think (hope) that cured it.
