level is setup for single player, but can be a co-op, and deathmatch.


        Well, this is the new and improved "Imps-r-Us 2", this is version 2.0 .
This is what i wanted 1.0 to be like, but i did not have DEU-GCC, or even know
it even existed. DEU-GCC gave me the memory i needed to complete the level the
way it should of been in the first place!.  It's still an e1m1, and hopefully
everyone will be happy that the BIG monsters are gone in this version, due to
complaints that it ruined the game. I didn't know that is what the masses 
enjoyed, but now i do. I took it as constructive criticism, and thanks to the
feedback i recieved, Im alot wiser :).

Thanks to Paracelus for the help getting me directed towards DEU-GCC

Also to Blackfist for "The Beginners Guide to DEU"

The DEU guys.... You know who you are!

And Id Software......................I Salute You!

Hopefully you will enjoy it.
