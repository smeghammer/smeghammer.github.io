Misc. Author Info       : Do you really care? :)

Description             : I have taken the time to make this
                          [what I feel] to be the most deathmatch-
                          suitable wad.  It has open space for 
                          great battles, and a lot of thought
                          has gone into the relationship between
                          rooms, platforms, etc.
                          Please email me if you do or do not
                          like this wad!  NOTE: This level does 
                          not contain the BFG9000.  If you want
                          it, you can add it yourself.  
                          This is my first wad -- I plan on making
                          more in the future, depending on the
                          success of this one.

                          editing and being patient with my
                          neophyte questions;  Steve Benner
                          for his time in writing up those
