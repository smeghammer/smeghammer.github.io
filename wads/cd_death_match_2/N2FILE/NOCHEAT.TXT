        NOTE: This is my first PWAD. I dont know why I named it nocheat.wad.
              I would Like to have responess and your comments..this being my 
              first PWAD. So please e-mail me and tell me what you think about it.
              Comments on lighting,monsters,weapons and bugs would be appreciated.
              Thank you and also this PWAD replaces level E2M1. This PWAD was built
              in DoomCad 4.3. There is hardly enough ammo for this PWAD, but you 
              can do it with out the cheat codes.
 
        BUGS: None so far!

        DON'T USE THE CHEAT 
        IT WRECKS TO PWAD
        LOSERS USE THE CHEAT
