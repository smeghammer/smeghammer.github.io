Misc. Author Info       : My second attempt at a level, my beta testers
			  have been complimentary, judging by the insults
			  about being a sick bastard <G>

Description             : Emphasis on secrets, traps and size ;-)
			  It helps to play E1M1 but it's not absolutely
			  necessary :-)
			  If you get 100% first time you used the
			  cheat codes (or you're a DAMN fime DOOMER!!!)
			  p.s. if you do it all 1st time/no cheats
			  mail me and i'll make a harder one <G>
			  p.s. This level takes loger to build with BSP than
			  it does for me to go to the bank (200 yards), get 
			  money, on to Vicky wine (another 200 say) to get 
			  some tabs and beer. And thats on a 486sx33 8Mb.

Additional Credits to   : Rapheal and Brendan, the DEU crew
			  Per Allanson & Per Kofod for making BIG levels
			  possible with the ported version.
			  Colin Read , without BSP physchadelic things happen
			  THE BETA TESTERS
			  Dean Rocks (sysop Happy Hippy BBS)
