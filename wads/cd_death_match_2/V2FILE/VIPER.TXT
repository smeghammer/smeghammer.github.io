   Hello everyone, 

                   ViPER Tech, a programming group, is currently looking for 
good ANSi and VGA artists. If you have talent, send us some of your best 
realizations and we'll check them out.

                   ViPER Tech is a programming group that I started with 
Screaming Demon. We're a few members right now, and we welcome anyone in 
the group. The group has released 3 or 4 things up to now, and we recently 
started working on something big. I cannot tell you any more, but if any of 
this sounds interesting, drop me a note, it'll be a pleasure for me to answer 
you and see what you could do to help us!

                   ViPER Tech - Ask me if you want to join, or if you want any
info. Our releases up to now are App-Gen 1.0, Mr. 8 Ball, LSD Wad, Gator-On-
a-Stick, a dice door game and the UFO/X-Com cheat. We are currently working 
on bigger projects, which will be  released during the next 12 months. Keep 
an eye out for them! And again, we welcome new members! One of the requirements 
is that you do something for the group. Coding, drawing, writing, anything 
that can help is great! 
                   
                   ViPER Tech uses high level languages for now - Turbo 
Pascal and C++. We do not yet use Assembly, but we look forward to do so. 
No matter what you code in, as long as it's fast enough, not too big, and 
you can give us .OBJs for linking. That's for coding. For artists, ANSi or 
VGA (SVGA) are the only formats accepted, unless you can provide better ones. 
If you want to draw VGA screens but do not have a program to do so, download 
IMPROCES from the graphics utils. section.
