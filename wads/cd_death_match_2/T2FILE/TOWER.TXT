Misc. Author Info       : One day late and One dollar short!

Description             : Episode 3 level 1 has always been kinda
			: lame for me. Not much happening there....and
			: the only way to crank it up a little was to
			: hurry thru it. TOWER.WAD replaces E3L1 with
			: what I attemped to be a "classic" type of
			: DOOM level. Check out the "BARON TUBE".
			: I should add that this wad was originally designed
			: for CO-OP play, but has been edited for single
			: player mode. (It's much more fun in co-op though).
			: If someone should try it...and you think it's too
			: busy...please let me know.
		
Additional Credits to   : Drew Lucy, for the Baron tube concept.
