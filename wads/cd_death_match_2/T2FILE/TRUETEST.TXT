Description             :   You are heading down the secret hallway leading to 
                          the teleporter back to Earth.  As you make your way
                          to well-earned freedom, you wonder why it seemed so
                          easy to waste the mighty Spiderdemon?
                            Just then, a ghostly apparition appears in the
                          corridor ahead.  It is one of your fallen comrades!
                          He speaks to you in a ghostly whisper, but you sense
                          a joy in his haunting voice.  He thanks you for 
                          rescuing his soul from that monstrous devil.  He 
                          begins to tell you of his last mission...
                            It seems that of the few space marines who made it
                          to the inferno of Hell, only he had a soul too pure
                          to be corrupted by the teleporter gates.  He fought 
                          valiantly, but was soon captured-not killed!  The 
                          hideous Spiderdemon saw a power in that soul he 
                          could use for his own.  In an unholy ceremony, the 
                          Spiderdemon split the marine into two parts--a body 
                          and a soul!
                            With the soul in his control, the Spiderdemon 
                          would gain even greater power and would be 
                          indestructable to any mortal!
                            But, there was one more part to complete the 
                          ceremony.  The only way for the Spiderdemon to 
                          truly possess the soul was to prove that the body 
                          was not worthy of it.  A test for the human would 
                          be the last step of the arcane ritual. 
                            The Spiderdemon sent him back to Phobos to a
                          special arena built just for the occasion.  If he
                          could fight his way to retrieve his soul, he would
                          be worthy of it.  If he failed, the Spiderdemon
                          would become invincible and he would suffer an 
                          eternity of torment.  If he succeeded, he would be
                          returned to Earth.  
                            In the end, he was victorious, but the Spiderdemon
                          broke the rules of the ritual and laid a final trap
                          for him.  He was killed and his body taken back to
                          Hell as a trophy.  
                            His soul was also brought back and it watched as 
                          the Spiderdemon's ritual backfired on him. The  
                          monster received a great blast of energy in punishment
                          for his blasphemous actions!
                            The demon was weakened, but very much alive.  He
                          unleashed his fury on the only thing he could, the
                          soul of the poor marine!  Even though he could never
                          use its power, he was determined to torture the man 
                          who cheated him out of immortality.  It wasn't until
                          you destroyed the weakened Spiderdemon that he was
                          set free.
                            The spirit turns and begins to float away, but you
                          call out for him to wait.  You ask him to tell you 
                          more of this final mission.  As you look into the 
                          misty face, you see a comrade who used to swap tales
                          of adventure with you often.  You ask him for 1 last
                          war story.  He smiles and begins to tell, in detail,
                          of his most heroic mission.  This is that tale.....
