Misc. Info		: This is my first attempt at a wad.
			I sure hope you enjoy it... it took me forever to build.

Description		: Lately, the sewers beneath the moonbase you are stationed at
			have been acting oddly.  No plumbing works, the base is overheated,
			something isn't right.  Then earlier this morning, a man was pulled 
			through his shower drain by something... it wasn't a pretty sight.
			Now something has to be done.  As you stand before the entrance to the
			sewer tunnels you take a glance back at your watching comrades and 
			wonder if you'll ever see them again...
