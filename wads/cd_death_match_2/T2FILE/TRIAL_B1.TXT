Description             : This is basically an unfinished wad.  I wanted to have
			  some outside input.  I plan on expanding the level and 
			  maybe adding more levels.  This all depends on time and
			  if I can figure out a good theme for my doom world.
			  If you have any comments / flames please E-Mail me or
			  post to alt.games.doom.  This is my first attempt at
			  creating a playable doom level, so any advice would be 
			  great :)

Additional Credits to   : Thanks to all those DOOM Gods at Id for the world's best
			  war, er game!!!
