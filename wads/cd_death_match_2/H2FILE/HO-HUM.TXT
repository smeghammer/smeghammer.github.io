Description             : OK, so this is my first WAD, & it grewed so the 
                          theme is only that its best to shoot from cover 
                          wherever possible ;-)  A variety of rooms and 
                          plenty of beasties in convenient GULP sized 
                          packets.  Ammo IS adequate, so it can be done 
                          in UV, honest Guv.  (I'm a ten Guv-a-day man, 
                          always have been, always will be)
