Description             : This is my first DOOM2 PWAD. Open areas and 
                          twisting passages abound. A grand hall filled with 
                          all your favorite demons. Something strange, and 
                          a secret or two. Had a heck of time finishing it,
                          DEU would reach its memory limit and crash 
                          repeatedly. So...I used the old gcc 32 bit DEU 5.2
                          then went back and insert DOOM2 onjects and 
                          textures. Not going to DEU it anymore...
