FTP sites: ocf.unt.edu in /pub/incoming/halls.zip, soon under the
           /pub/doom/wads structure.

BBS numbers: No.

Other: Email us and we'll tell you our addresses and you can come and
get it....;-)

Ending words: BTW, you can only exit if you have at least two players in
the game and they both co-operate to exit. The first player must press
the switch in the sniping-area which is located on the lava-place, which
opens the only door you have saw..Then, the other player, who is waiting
there, presses the "skin" switch besides the door which has just opened,
and the way to exit switch is all clear!

PS: Look for the next part of "Halls of Death", soon available in your
favourite ftp site!
