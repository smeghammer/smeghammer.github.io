* Description * 
   
   After completing your first mission in "The Nest", Space 
   Command has "volunteered" you to teleport into the old 
   deserted alien city on Ceiros 7.  Having learned your 
   lesson from the last fight with only a pistol, you opt 
   for more firepower and grab a rocket launcher and load 
   up with a couple of boxes of rockets.

   As you step toward the teleport, you can't help but 
   wonder: were you chosen because you did such a great 
   job last time, or such a terrible job...
