This level is pretty small compared to a lot of other levels but it has a
lot of action in it. It's pretty strait forward and not really a "puzzle"
type level. I made this really just for solo play but you can play it
as cooperation too. Although, if you DO play cooperation you'll all have
to stay together going down that first "elevator" or you'll be stuck.
You'll see what I mean! >:)   Well, enough of this babbling...
I'm off to UPLOAD this sucker...

Latr'...
