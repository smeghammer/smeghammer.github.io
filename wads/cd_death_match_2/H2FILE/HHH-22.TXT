Description             :   "Well, well, well..." started Hades, "You have 
			  solved that little puzzle(*) with amazing speed...
			  Good for you, my boy.  How about something tougher?"
			  Answering your icy glance, he quickly added "Okay,
			  just a _little_ tougher..."  His wide smile exposed
			  strong and healthy teeth.  Suddenly it came to your
			  mind that no one ever saw Hades smiling -- or did 
			  not live to tell about it?  "The problem is," he 
			  continued, "that I have one little palace I don't
			  really like.  One architect designed it for me some
			  time ago, he was trying to suck up to me, you know,
			  so I would let him live another 50 years or so.  
			  I didn't.  Anyway, the place didn't suit my taste,
			  really; it's so small and tight, and definitely not
			  warm enough for a winter palace.  So I decided that
			  with some remodeling it would make an interesting 
			  puzzle for you.  How about it?  Oh, come on, I know
			  you start to like these puzzles, don't you?"  His 
			  voice became more and more patronizing.  "It's good, 
			  you know, for your body, mind... and speed!"  he said,
			  and honoured you with another smile, clearly enjoying
			  himself.  Impatience, however, overcame him, and he 
			  quickly finished up his monologue -- "You are really
			  good in conversations.  It's a pity we've got to go 
			  now.  I can't wait to see you in that palace. I only
			  wonder how quickly you'll get out of there...
			  IF you'll get out...

Base                    : New level from scratch
Build Time              : 56 hours. ;)  
Editor(s) used          : DEU 5.1, BSP 1.1x recompiled
Known Bugs              : There are some problems with the 2-sided linedefs
			  in two tall rooms: the first room with the windows,
			  and the one with the deep acid pit.  Sometimes when
			  walking thru a linedef without any texture, it may 
			  seem as if walking thru a gray wall.  It's a Doom 
			  engine's problem, and not my or DEU's fault.
