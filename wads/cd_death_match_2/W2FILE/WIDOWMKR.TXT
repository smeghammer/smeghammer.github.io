Description

After your return from Hell and a nice 6 month vacation, you received
an urgent message from Union Aerospace Corporation today.  They started  
picking up strange signals from an island (Widowmaker) on the other side
of Deimos recently.  It seems that a few of the inhabitants from Deimos
Lab escaped before you were able to get them.  

You were happy to help in any way that you could, but it seems that your
baggage ended up on Venus while you landed on Mars to begin your mission.
You almost waited, but you entered their lair before with only a pistol.
And it's such a small island.  How hard could it be?

Authors MAY use this level as a base to build additional
levels providing I get credit.  A little e-mail would be 
nice (but not necessary) as well just so I can see what
you've done.


You MAY distribute this WAD, provided you include this file, with
no modifications.  You may distribute this file in any electronic
format (BBS, Diskette, CD, etc) as long as you include this file 
intact.

NOTE:  I asked id about creating a CD with all the files from
infant2.sphs.indiana.edu on it.  They did not give me permission
to do so.  They say that they do not want people commercially
exploiting PWAD author's efforts whether the above statement was
included in a PWAD or not.  And their defination of commercial
exploitation is anything more than free.

I think this attitude (though they have the right intentions) is
absolutely stupid.  And if you think so as well, drop them a line
and let them know.  Nor do I believe that they really have any power
to stop such a CD from being sold.  After all, their only connection
to our PWAD's is that their game can utilitize the files.  Just
like Microsoft can't tell me what I can or can't do with Word files.
I just don't want them to not include the ability to run custom built
levels in future games because people don't respect their wishes.

Well, enough of my soapbox.  If someone does make such a CD, you DO
have my permission as stated above.
