Title                   : Walltrap ver 1.0
Author                  : Martin Beggerman
Description             : This .WAD is a variation of a file by another
                          Author. Great for Deathmatches. I varied it
                          by increasing the Wall height and type and
                          added a few enemies and weapons. Several
                          transports to keep people out in the middle
                          of things to keep fragging.
