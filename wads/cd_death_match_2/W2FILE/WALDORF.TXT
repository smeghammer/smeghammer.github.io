Description             : A collection of 4 made from scratch levels 
                          designed specifically for new deathmatch.
                          One mini-episode covering maps 1-4 with 
                          difficulty settings applicable for some 
                          of the levels.  Meant to be played at skill
                          3.  This is the level with the correct amount
                          of baddies for deathmatch.  Make sure to have
                          weapons and baddies respawn. This wad is good   
                          for slower machines.  Nothing too complex 
                          going on here, although they are very creative.  
                          All levels have exits usable on single player,
                          some are hard to find though.
