Hi everybody....

        Two months ago, in the Meeting'94 coding party, we started 
        building an episode. Now it's well over and, now that we've 
        just found out BSP, we can release it.

It's including :
                
                1- ANYWHERE.WAD         by Bob & Baluk ( July 94 )

                        A tiny level based upon a simple idea :
                        always look behind you when you're roaming
                        in Doom corridors...

                2- NUKES.WAD            by Baluk       ( August 94 )

                        My latter pwad. I spent pretty much time to
                        look after the design of this level and, if 
                        of course I could make better, it's rather 
                        nice.

                3- SHAFT69.WAD          by Baluk       ( July 94 )

                        A simple level turning around a shaft : it's 
                        the main feature of that. As for the name, I
                        didn't choose the number randomly :-).

                4- COLUMNS.WAD          by Baluk       ( July 94 )

                        My first level, full of simple but quite 
                        efficient traps. I spent a lot of time on 
                        it, and the result is rather good.

                5- DUNGEON.WAD          by Baluk       ( July 94 )

                        My best level regarding as the atmosphere :
                        I'm a fan of ADD role-playing games and I 
                        wanted to recreate the dark corridors of a 
                        dungeon.

                6- MEETING.WAD          by Bob (Map by Baluk) ( July 94 )

                        Our first wad, first released at The Meeting'94
                        coding party. I've just drown the map while Bob
                        builded it with DEU. It was our first levelmakers'
                        emotions...

                7- VOLCANO.WAD          by Cortex & Baluk    ( August 94 )

                        Some nasty traps here; I think Cortex has some 
                        very good ideas sometimes. I've just builded it.
                        It's very huge, but you will can do it!

                8- WHEEL.WAD            by Baluk     ( July 94 )

                        An end level, in the ID tradition. Just to check
                        if you can fight some nasty monsters.

                9- DZI.WAD              by Bob       ( August 94 )

                        A secret level, short but ending with Barons...


Now I don't know what I'm going to do, except waiting for Hell On 
Earth...
Or building another new episode...

Happy Dooming!!
                                        Baluk, September 14th, 1994

Post Scriptum : 

Yeah I've just played this episode in UV and I think that you would 
be interested by my times... They could serve for par-times, coz I've 
got 100% everywhere... Of course I dont know all the levels by heart
for nothing...

So here they are:
                Level 1 : 01:45
                Level 2 : 07:00
                Level 3 : 05:00
                Level 4 : 10:00
                Level 5 : 12:00
                Level 6 : 13:30
                Level 7 : 18:00
                Level 8 : 02:00
                Level 9 : 04:45

Just beat them all !

Bye!
                                        Baluk
