Misc. Author Info       : Everything I ever needed to know I learned
                          on the Shores of Hell.

Description             I think this level is a great one.  Something
                        for everyone I hope.  I'm sure you've never seen
                        some of the things that are in my twisted head.

                        The moon base water treatment and recycling
                        center started reporting strange happenings
                        deep in there sewer system a few weeks ago.
                        Just days later a garbled transmission during
                        the sounds of battle made it through to the UAC
                        outpost on Deimos 4.
                        
                        "Nuke us.......it's the only.....have to...
                        ....cant make this......sewers...cavern...
                        from hell" 
                        
                        was all that could be understood from the message.
                        Not much to go on, but that's what you're used to.
                        They don't give you any easy ones, and you don't get
                        to ask to many questions.

                        The UAC needs you to investigate and "rectify" any
                        potential hazards on the water treatment facility.

                        Good luck.

==============================
Episode and Level #     : E2M1
Single Player           : Yes
Cooperative 2-4 Player  : Yes
Deathmatch 2-4 Player   : Sort of, the starts are there.  You may want
                          to move 'em around a bit though.
Difficulty Settings     : Absolutely.  I think it plays best on Ultra
                          Violence.
                          

New Sounds              : No, they got annoying
New Graphics            : No, but wait till you see how I used the existing
                          textures!
New Music               : No, I'm a marine, not a musician.
Demos Replaced          : All - Watch the demos for a clue to the first
                          puzzle.  But I didn't want to spoil many secrets so
                          the good stuff is not in any of the demos.


* Construction *

Base                    : New level from scratch

Editor(s) used          : DEU, BSP, DMAUD

Build Time              : All my LIFE!!!!

Known Bugs              : Bugs?  You think I spend hundreds of hours on this
                          for bugs?.....Jeeez.  Seriously, I tested this to
                          death.  There's a bit of a flash when you enter or
                          exit one very tall room.  It doesn't always happen
                          and I don't think it takes away from the game.  I
                          thought about writing my own DOOM like engine to
                          get around the problem.  I could do it, yeah, and
                          monkeys might fly out of my butt.

                          There's also a microscopic HOM effects in one room,
                          but if you are looking closely enough to see it,
                          you're gonna get clobbered by the Coca's on top
                          of you.
