Description           : Yet another DOOM ][ DeathMatch only wad.
                        Designed for a fast paced Frag Fest!
                          
                        Made primarily for DM 1.0 (skill 3) 
                        but added some stuff for DM 2.0 (all other skills)

                        All weapons are in interesting places, all
                        deathmatch starts are by weapons (to avoid
                        looking for a weapon frags), the big weapons
                        (BFG, plasma) are harder to get than other weapons 
                        and some thought actually went into the design, 
                        it was NOT just thrown together.
                          
                        There are NO monsters, if ya want 'em add your own...
