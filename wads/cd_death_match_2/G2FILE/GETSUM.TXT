                         See if I can do it.

Description             
                         :I made this wad for Cooperative play. 
                         (IT'S Hard If only one player play's
                         But Can be done. I Did it.) For a Added Twist,  
                         Try Running GETSUM.BAT With Dehacked in the DOOM dir.
                         Then Don't Beleave every thing you see?        
                         (Some things are best leaft alone until later?)
                         IT Should (it will) return doom to it's normal 
                         DEADLY SELF When you exit.
