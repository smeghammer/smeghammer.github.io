Misc. Author Info       : Everything I really needed to know I learned
                          on the Shores of Hell.

Description             This is the final revision to The Gathering.  I
                        put the starts in on each level for deathmatch 
                        play.  I think E2M3 is probably your best bet.

                        The original file was a large one level mission.
                        added an entire mission E2M1 and added a lot more
                        rooms to the original, which I split into two separate
                        levels.  They're fun.

                        I think these levels are great.  Something
                        for everyone I hope.  I'm sure you've never seen
                        some of the things that are in my twisted head.

                        The moon base water treatment and recycling
                        center started reporting strange happenings
                        deep in there sewer system a few weeks ago.
                        Just days later a garbled transmission during
                        the sounds of battle made it through to the UAC
                        outpost on Deimos 4.
                        
                        "Nuke us.......it's the only.....have to...
                        ....cant make this......sewers...cavern...
                        from hell" 
                        
                        was all that could be understood from the message.
                        Not much to go on, but that's what you're used to.
                        They don't give you any easy ones, and you don't get
                        to ask to many questions.

                        The UAC needs you to investigate and "rectify" any
                        potential hazards on the water treatment facility.

                        Good luck.
                        
                        Dang! what the heck was that?  Just two tunnels and
                        an underpass from the UAC water treatment plant.  The
                        driver never saw the creature waiting in the tunnel.  
                        In a flash it was over.  Nothing could have survived
                        that crash... you could be wrong ... you did.  I guess
                        your on foot now.  Be careful, the truck that was
                        escorting you was carrying emercency supplies for the
                        plant personnel and some toxic waste.  Watch it,  that 
                        stuff is flammable.
                       

Additional Credits to   : My wife.  She is absolutely the greatest gal
                          in the whole world.  A true DOOM widow at times
                          but alway delightful.

                          the greatest space marine in UAC history.
                          Mike spent hours playtesting this level.
                          Thanks for the encouragement.

                        : ID Software - WOW!  Thank you so much.  This has
                          become a way of life.

                        : Collin Reed for the BSP Utility

                        : Raphael Quinet and Brendon Wyber for the awesome
                          DEU 5.21 editor.  You guys are brainiacs.

                        : My mother, the acadamy and all my grade school
                          friends..... ;)

* Play Information *
Copy the unzipped files to your DOOM directory and run GATHER.
That's    G A T H E R  then press Enter for you PC infants.

It would look like this from DOS:

CD\DOOM
GATHER

If you had your monitor off it would look like this:






Once your in DOOM pick Shores of Hell and hop to it.

==============================
Episode and Level #     : E2M1, E2M2, E2M3
Single Player           : Yes
Cooperative 2-4 Player  : Yes
Deathmatch 2-4 Player   : YES
Difficulty Settings     : Absolutely.  I think it plays best on Ultra
                          Violence.  E2M3 is a challenge.
                          

New Sounds              : No, they got annoying
New Graphics            : No, but wait till you see how I used the existing
                          textures!
New Music               : No, I'm a marine, not a musician.
Demos Replaced          : All - Watch the demos for a clue to the first
                          puzzle.  But I didn't want to spoil many secrets so
                          the good stuff is not in any of the demos.


* Construction *

Base                    : New level from scratch

Editor(s) used          : DEU, BSP

Build Time              : All my LIFE!!!!

Known Bugs              : Bugs?  You think I spend hundreds of hours on this
                          for bugs?.....Jeeez.  Seriously, I tested this to
                          death.  There's a bit of a flash when you enter or
                          exit one very tall room.  It doesn't always happen
                          and I don't think it takes away from the game.  I
                          thought about writing my own DOOM like engine to
                          get around the problem.  I could do it, yeah, and
                          monkeys might fly out of my butt.
