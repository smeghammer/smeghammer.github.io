Authors (MAY) use this level as a base to build additional
levels, but I wouldn't advise it.  I had many problems creating
it.  No one editor was satifactory.  It got to a point where I
would get mirrors and passable walls in strange places whenever
I added anything new.  I would spare you this agony.  If I could
have continued, this level would have been three times as large.
