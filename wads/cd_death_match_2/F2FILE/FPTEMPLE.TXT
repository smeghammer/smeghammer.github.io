Misc. Author Info     : An 18 year old Australian, creater of quite a few WADS
                        which have since become VERY popular.
                        Also created BalrogRV.wad and enigma.wad, and wrote
                        the extremely popular Deu2.tip document.

Description           :  Wad file is designed for multi-player deathmatch. 
                         Naturally it has no monsters, and plenty of ammo and 
                         health.
                         The setting is a (fantastically decorated) temple,
                         where evil priests conduct secret rituals, raising
                         hideous monsters. The teleport at the entrance is
                         the only means of gaining entry to it.
                         There are'nt any tricks etc, but WAD designers may
                         wish to have a look how things were done...:)
                         The exit is found outside on the platform, which is
                         reached by activating the switch in the altar room.
                         This means co-operation is needed to finish the level
                         Ideally for 4 players, but is great for less. 
                         This was made for the doomII server on Flashpoint BBS

                          of his, and helping me de-bug this lvl. Thanx Russ!
