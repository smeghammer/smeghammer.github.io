       INTO THE FIRE: A REPLACEMENT DOOM EPISODE FOR ADVANCED PLAYERS
                         Written By Scott Adams
=============================================================================
        Here is the sequel to Hell's Bells, the nearly impossible version 
  of the first episode.  Now that you've graduated to this episode, be
  ready for a no-holds-barred battle!

        Due to several requests, I have added more ammo, but only at points
  where it is ABSOLUTELY necessary!  You are likely to still have to use the
  chainsaw a many points.  I also have added a few stimpacks preceeding or
  proceeding a large fight.  But, along with these aids, I have added some
  traps and surprises.  Hopefully, this should make this episode more 
  exciting that the last!

        The files included will patch over the levels in the second episode
  (The Shores Of Hell).  This change is NOT permanent, nor will it change
  your files.  As soon as you exit the game, the changes are removed.  I have
  tested it on my system with no problem.   
  
        Note: I did NOT edit the second to last level.  After playing it        
        a few times, I decided it was tough enough.

        To run, do the following:

        1. Unzip the program, or copy the files, into you doom directory. 
        
        2. Run the file FIRE.BAT

        3. Select New Game, then The Shores Of Hell, then Ultra-Violence.

        4. Enjoy! 

                More is on the way...keep your shotgun loaded!
