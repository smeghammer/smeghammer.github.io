Description             : I designed this level after being somewhat                                        dissapointed with most of the deathmatch PWADS
                          out there. I've put in most of what I've learned
                          playing netdoom. Which are:
                          1)Keep it small.
                          2)Good sniping spots.
                          3)Opportunities for telefragging.
                          4)Neato design.
