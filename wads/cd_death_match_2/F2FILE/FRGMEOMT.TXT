***Notes on Difficulty Settings***

Skills 1 and 2:
        Contains all of the weapons except the BFG and no soul
        spheres or megaspheres.  Just enough monsters to keep 
        things interesting.  Great with -altdeath and -respawn.

Skill 3:
        Same as skills 1 and 2, except this difficulty setting also 
        has a megasphere and a BFG for those of you that
        like these items in deathmatch.  Should also be good with
        -altdeath and -respawn.

skill 4:
        Weapons are the same as Skills 1 and 2, but the amount
        and difficulty of monsters has been greatly increased.
        There is no BFG or soul spheres (etc.).
