      1) This .WAD file is for deathmatch only, it is pointless to play
         it by yourself because there is no EXIT!
      2) Weapons: Well, all of them. 
      3) This .WAD was designed using DE_260B2.ZIP. This is an excellent 
         DOOM utility.
      4) Shareware this is not, it is BEERWARE. If you like the .WAD 
         drink a beer in honor of the programer.

      
       The idea behind this level is to play with one other person in a
      deathmatch game. As stated before, it is pointless to play it by
      yourself. The level is set up so that both players start in good
      starting places. I recommend you use -respawn because there aren't
      a lot of monsters.
       To run the game either use the batch file that is in the dir. or
      type (while in your doom dir.)doom -file YCRBYCH.wad.
       If you have any problems or questions drop me a line on SMUG BBS.
      or DANGER ZONE BBS.
