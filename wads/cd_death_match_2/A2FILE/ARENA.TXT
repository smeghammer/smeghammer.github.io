DMARENA.ZIP CONTAINS THE FOLLOWING FILES:

        README.!!! (YOU'RE READING IT)
        ARENA.WAD  (MODIFIED DOOM DATA FILE, REPLACES E1L1)

COPY ARENA.WAD INTO YOUR DOOM DIRECTORY. 

TO PLAY THE ARENA.WAD PATCH FROM YOUR DOOM DIRECTORY, TYPE:

FOR STAND ALONE PLAY    ----->  DOOM -FILE ARENA.WAD
FOR NETWORK/MODEM PLAY  ----->  SERSETUP -FILE ARENA.WAD -EPISODE 1 -NET #/COM#

-->ONCE IN GAME CHOOSE "KNEE DEEP IN THE DEAD" (SEE BELOW FOR DIFFICULTY*)

THIS PATCH FILE WILL NOT WORK IN THE SHAREWARE VERSION OF DOOM. THERE ARE 
TEXTURES AND MONSTERS IN THIS PATCH FILE THAT ARE NOT IN THE SHAREWARE
VERSION.

CAUTION! 
~~~~~~~~
YOU MAY EXPERIENCE SOME MIRRORING EFFECT NEAR THE OUTER WALLS OF THIS
LEVEL. I HAVE TRIED AND TRIED AGAIN TO GET RID OF IT, AND SUCCEEDED IN 
GETTING MOST OF IT TO GO AWAY. BUT IT OCCASIONALLY HAPPENS. JUST IGNORE 
IT AND CONTINUE PLAY, IT DID NOT HAMPER MY PLAY IN ANY WAY. SORRY!

SPECIAL NOTES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
THE ARENA IS A .WAD FILE I MADE FOR USE OVER MODEM/NETWORK PLAY IN DEATHMATCH
MODE. IT IS A VERY LARGE PLAY FIELD WITH LOTS OF WEAPONS AND POWER-UPS.
MONSTERS ARE ALSO QUITE ABUNDANT. I HAVE TRIED IT SEVERAL TIMES AND IT IS 
QUITE FUN TO PLAY.

*RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PLAY!! (MUST READ)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
DUE TO THE LARGE MAP AND MANY MONSTERS YOU MIGHT EXPERIENCE A SLOW DOWN.
TO HELP SOLVE THE PROBLEM YOU MAY WANT TO TURN OFF THE MONSTERS OR SELECT 
THE "HURT ME PLENTY" DIFFICULTY LEVEL (HALF THE MONSTERS) ON 
COMPUTERS SLOWER THAN A 486-33. ON MY 486-66 IT RUNS FINE, EVEN OVER THE
MODEM.

COMPUTER SPEED:  486SX-25       USE -NOMONSTERS
                 486DX-33       PLAY ON HURT ME PLENTY (HALF AS MANY MONSTERS)
                 486DX2-66 OR > PLAY ON ULTRA-VIOLENCE

THIS MODIFIED LEVEL IS THE RESULT OF 7+ HOURS OF EDITING AND TESTING. I HAVE
DONE MY BEST TO MAKE THIS LEVEL FUN YET POSE A CHALLENGE.
