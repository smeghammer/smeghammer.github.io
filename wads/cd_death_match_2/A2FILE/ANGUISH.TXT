Description            : After a weekend of R&R, you return to your base to 
			find your unit has not returned from routine 
			maneuvers on Mars. Upon checking in with your CO, you 
			find him a changed person. He only moans, "Despair, 
			Despair, Why did it have to be Despair." Your 
			comrades had been sent to pay a routine visit to 
			UAC's genetics and physics lab knicknamed "Despair" 
			because of its remote location. Grabbing your 
			sidearm, you head for the hanger some call the "Gates 
			of Anguish" to begin your search for the fate of your 
			comrades. Your journey begins with a quick flight to 
			the remote landing pad cut into the red rock. Your 
			shuttle deserts you as the first shots are fired, 
			leaving you no easy way back. From here on, its just 
			you against the denizens of the hellish place.  


			Please E-Mail me with your comments on CIS. Your 
			comments go a long toward improving my 'work'.

Instructions          : Put ANGUISH.WAD and ANGUISH.BAT in your DOOM 
			directory, then run the batch file.  This takes you 
			right into it, skiping the intro stuff, chooses "Hey, 
			Not Too Rough" skill, and jump right into the level.  
			Modify the batch file with -skill # as you please. 
			Otherwise, choose New Game, Shores of Hell, and the 
			skill level you prefer and play thru as normal.
