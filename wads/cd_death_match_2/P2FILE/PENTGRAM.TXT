Misc. Author Info       : I forgot to pay my vehicle registration and was a 
			  day late in paying my parking ticket.....  To all
			  those fundamentalist Christians that might be 
			  playing Doom...  No apologies.  Take a look.  Like
			  it (or even hate it) or leave it.

Description             : There's nothing quite as evil as the sign of Satan
			  itself...  Well, maybe certain farts might be 
			  considered more evil.......
			  If you haven't done so yet, go play HUNTER.WAD.

Additional Credits to   : Anton Szandor LaVey (Founder of the Church of Satan
			  and author of the Satanic Bible) for the idea.  It's

* Where to get this WAD *

FTP sites: If I can EVER figure it out.. I'll put it up on ftp.uwp.edu.  Or
	   if a kind soul would do that for me. 

BBS numbers: The Wine Cooler (310)860-9171.  Has a dedicated "home-brew"
	     doom directory.

The story thus far:

	You've almost made it.  Only two more weeks of hard work and one more
training mission and you'll be shipping out to adventure.  Aboard the troop
transport headed to the staging area, you review the combat reports a final
Time.
	"....will require tactical thinking as well as evaluation prowess.
The mission will require that the recruit pay attention to details in a greater
extent than in the previous training mission.
	"The training mission will test a recruit's ability to maintain his
concentration while under attack by camoflauged assailants.  In situations
where multiple recruits battle for supremacy, each of the participants will 
need to exercise their judgement regarding the use of advantageous positions
which may already be occupied or may be the first to fall under opponent fire.
Once again, wise judgment and attention to details will be stressed."
	Terrific, you say to yourself.  Just what you needed to do.... THINK.
You pull out your orders for when you complete training.  Guard duty on a 
docking station on Mars.  UAC calls it Docking Crater Alpha.  The place has
been in active service as a supply drop off point for 40 years and it's 
falling apart.  But for now you set that aside.  Right now you're touching
down and have to prepare to fight on Satan's ground.  Terrific.


	You might recognize me from my previous Doom level, HUNTER.WAD.  I
figured I might as well make a "sequel" of sorts.  This level is pretty cool
looking once it's been thoroughly explored and viewed from the map.  The exit
itself is kind of tough to access for those of slightly feeble minds.  The 
level itself is easier to complete than HUNTER.  It can also be used as a
deathmatch arena, although it may be a bit too big for serious fast action
unless you limit the boundaries.  But what fun is that.  There are still a 
couple of areas to set up pseudo ambushes and stuff.  

	I did most of my serious babbling in HUNTER.TXT so I'll keep it short
here.  

	A few hints:

	There IS a way to kill the bad guy(s) behind curtain #1 without firing 
a shot...

	What symbolizes goodness, a white cross or an upside down red cross?

	If the situation looks bad, then it probably is.

	Avoid the pentagram's eyes.

	And I say again.......  I don't scatter dead bodies around for my 
health or for theirs.
       
	Finally:

	No, I am not a Satanist, nor do I ever plan on being one.  I just 
happen to enjoy collecting various forms of literature.  Besides, the teleport
pads in Doom are based on runic symbols out of the Necronomicon, the book of
the dead.

	Peace.
