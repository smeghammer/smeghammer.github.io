This is a pWAD file of my favourite DMatch level E2M8.
This is defintely a DMatch level - there are few monsters
and, as of right now, no exit.  I'm working on getting the
exit fixed, but as of right now, you have to drop out.
If you are playing DMatch with two players over a modem
or an iffy LAN, this lack of exit won't be noticed since 
the game will probably lock up before you get to the stage
where you would want to exit, anyway. <grin>

Still, I changed all of the textures, the items and the
light levels and it _does_ make a great DMatch level for
three or four players.

To use: doom -file pat.wad
(I forget how to warp to a level in a DMatch game from the
command line), but in one player mode, use IDCLEV 2 8
Created using: newdeu ver. 4.31 - the best doom editor
currently available!
