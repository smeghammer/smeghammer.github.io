Misc. Author Info       : The "Pina" series of doom levels were done
                          by my friend Paul Pina.  We have spent years
                          searching for that perfect game we could enjoy
                          together, and many thanks to the whiz kids
                          at id software for coming up with Doom and
                          making not only our dreams come true, but for 
                          inventing a truly neat electronic world.
                          Also (almost) equal thanks to BlackFist,
                          aka Rich Dersheimer for DEU5, a most excellent
                          Doom editor with which this level was created.
                          
Description             : Plenty of hidden passages and lots of room
                          to run hide and explore. Good for a Death match.
                          I built this level to confuse you. Enjoy any bugs
                          sorry, drop me a line at the above address.
