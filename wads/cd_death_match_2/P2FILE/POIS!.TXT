Title                   : Poisonous Prison, or Get Poised

Misc. Author Info       : This is my third PWAD that is actually decent
                        I think it is pretty good.  It is the first
                        level in an episode I am making called
                        Eye of the Beholder, which should come out
                        by the end of 1996.

Description             : O.K. Here's the story.  You were sent to
                        rescue two of your friends.  They were
                        captured by an enemy ship, piloted by
                        Cacodemons and placed in a high security
                        prison.  You beam into the prison only to
                        realize that your friends have been genetically
                        altered and are waiting for you, in their cells, with
                        shotguns.  You call for backup, but nobody responds.
                        You are trapped in the Cacodemon prison.  Be careful
                        not to trip the alarm system...

Additional Credits to   : ID software for some of the ideas for this level.
                                I took the armor secret from the level,
                                Gotcha, from DOOM II. I took the blue
                                skull key fencing idea from The Inmost Dens,
                                DOOM II.  Took the Marble Face Pillar from
                                The Courtyard, DOOM II.

my name in  any PWAD that incorporates MONSTER ACTIVATED SECRETS.  I have
never seen either of these ideas anywhere and I thought of them, so don't
be a jerk and copy them without giving me recognition.  If you are unclear
about either of my ideas, check out !poisdem!.zip.  It is a demo that gets 
all the secrets.
