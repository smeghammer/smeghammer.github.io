Misc. Author Info       : The "Pina" series of doom levels were done
                          by my friend Paul Pina.  We have spent years
                          searching for that perfect game we could enjoy
                          together, and many thanks to the whiz kids
                          at id software for coming up with Doom and
                          making not only our dreams come true, but for 
                          inventing a truly neat electronic world.
                          Also (almost) equal thanks to BlackFist,
                          aka Rich Dersheimer for DEU5, a most excellent
                          Doom editor with which this level was created.

Description             :This level I tried to get a tier effect. There 
                         are many hidden doors and Keys.(you will need 2)
                         As in all my wads there is a hidden switch to end 
                         the level. Lots of bad guys a perfect level for 2 
                         or more. Look for the key to open the hidden door
                         that leads to the way out. Weapons availability
                         You can get every where but remember teleporters
                         have 4 sides... this means I can send you 4 a
                         different way depending which side you use(BIG
                         HINT) good luck let me know if you like it or hate
                         It.
                         (Chain gun, Plasma gun, Shotgun, Rocket Launcher)
