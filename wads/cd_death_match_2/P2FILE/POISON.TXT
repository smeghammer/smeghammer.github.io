Description             : An environmentalist's nightmare.  Mostly toxic 
                          waste with some other areas to explore.  (Hint:
                          try to save the radiation suits)  This is my first
                          (successful) PWAD.  Being able to navigate through
			  the ooze quickly is a valuable asset in this level.
			  I have been able to get through the level with 
			  the radiation suits provided, but don't get dis-
			  couraged if it takes you several tries.

Additional Credits to   : My father for getting all of the necessary
                          programs, the people who created these programs
                          and the great guys at ID.
