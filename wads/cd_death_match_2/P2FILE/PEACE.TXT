Description             : A DEATHMATCH ONLY level for professional
                          deathmatch players ! It's small and very
                          fast. There are all weapons and an exit.
                          The level is based on shadows2, but
                          there is almost everything changed.
                          We began to modify shadows2.wad for our
                          own purpose only, but the result was to
                          good to keep it unpublished (and we spent
                          to much time now to rebuild the level
                          from scratch).
