Description             : This level is a recreation of an old west town.
			  Much attention has been paid to the balance and
			  design of this level.  There is NO BFG, and the
			  lone plasma rifle is hard to get.  Shotguns and
			  super shotguns are everywhere.  Chainguns and
			  rocket launchers are also available.  However, 
			  this is definately a shotgun level!  As of yet,
			  there are NO monsters.  That may change, however.

Misc Game Info          : DOOM II WAD. This WAD is error free. It's been 
			  play tested for over 20 hours. It should run fine on a
			  386 or a 486. It's been played on both.

Additional Credits to   : Thanks to the many guys on ifrag for 
			  play testing this wad.  You know who you are!                    ing development.
