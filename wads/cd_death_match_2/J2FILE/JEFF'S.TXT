HI THERE!  I am here to lead you on a wonderful journey...
I recommend saving your game many times throughout your adventure since it 
is very likely you will die many times.

However, I do not recommend playing on nightmare level since it should be 
quite impossible... Level 4 with degreeless mode on could be very interesting
though.

This is a Doom2 level.  Map01!

Have fun!!!!  Love me Kender ------------
