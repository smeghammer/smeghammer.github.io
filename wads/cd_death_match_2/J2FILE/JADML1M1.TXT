Just Another Death Match Level E1M1

I threw this one together in a quick hour, it's a good low level Deathmatch
level (shotgun,chainsaw & chaingun) very limited ammo, and only the shotguns
are sticky :)
I haven't tried it multi-player (yet), so there may be a few bugs with multi
play.

Note, textures aren't aligned well (or at all :), and for those wishing to
go on to something better, the sparkly blue walls are the exits.


One bug I do know about (but couldn't find in my brief search) is by the
eastern player starting alcove, in the dark (normal play ;) the shaded
triangle seems to bleed toward the player, if you figure this out drop me
a note via choppe@hubcap.clemson.edu .
