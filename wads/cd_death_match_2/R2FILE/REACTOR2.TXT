Description: 
        After cleaning out one of UAC's power plants, you drop 
        all your extra weapons and baggage, then jump into the 
        transporter to return to your ship.  As your molecules 
        start to scramble, you suddenly realize you forgot to
        set any coordinates for the transport.  In a matter of
        a picosecond, many different possible landing sites
        pass through your mind, such as deep space, the center 
        of an active volcano, or hell itself.  As you start to
        materialize, another picosecond is spent wishing you
        hadn't left the heavy weapons behind.
