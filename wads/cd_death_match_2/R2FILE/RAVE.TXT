Description             : This a DEATHMATCH level! This means no monsters, 
                      death traps, or strange puzzles. The purpose of this 
                      level is to have the most fun possible while slaying
                      your friends. A great feature of this wad is one I 
                      have not seen in any deathmatch wads to date. There are 
                      4 sets of lightswitches, each set has a on and an off
                      switch. Hear your buddies fighting down below? Hit the
                      lights and leap down to join the fray!  
                      Also, if you like leaping down dozens of stories, this
                      is the wad for you. The central chamber has a floor 
                      height of -511, and ceiling of 511. Two lifts access
                      the chamber, as well as several corridors. Fun sniping 
                      spots. One hard-to-get megasphere.

                          hours of playtesting and slaying that I have
                          enjoyed.
