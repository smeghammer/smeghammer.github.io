Misc. Author Info       : Yes, it's my first level.  I would
	welcome BRIEF e-mail comments on this level, however
	the above address will not be valid after May 1995.

Description             : Primarily a Deathmatch level, but 
	single player and cooperative games are supported.
	Imagine each player (in Deathmatch) is dropped into

	multi-leveled assylum, plug it in and face your fears!
