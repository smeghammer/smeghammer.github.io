New DOOM level, Registered Version Episode 3, Level 5.

Not too complex in architecture, but lots of ammo and tons of
badboys to kill!!

I created this in DOOMCad without too many problems.  At the
prompt, type

DOOM -FILE BADBOY35.WAD

then start a new game, any episode, any skill level..  Type the
following:

IDCLEV35

Have fun!
