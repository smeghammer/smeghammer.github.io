Description             : DOOM ][ DEATHMATCH WAD
                          After playing many, many, good Deathmatch PWADS, 
                          I decided to build a killer DeathMatch wad. It
                          has a couple of nice, open 'arenas' to battle in,
                          some strategically placed darkness, and NO shortage
                          of weapons or ammo. There is also a couple of ways to
                          double back on your buddy. I hope you like it as
                          much as we do.

Instructions            : Put BRIANS.WAD in your DOOM2 directory, change to that
                          directory and type "doom2 -file brians.wad -warp 1 -skill <#>"
                          Like it takes a brain surgeon to figure that out.

                          or even minor inconveniences this PWAD causes you,
                          your family, your relatives, friends, ancestors,
                          associates, employers, pets, neighbors, lovers,
                          congressional representatives, nor any other person--
                          living, dead, or undead -- that you have or will ever
                          have any contact with in even the slightest form.
                          This PWAD has been tested and tested and tested, so
                          it shouldn't mess with your computer or anything else
                          remotely associated with it.  But if it DOES, then
                          that's just TUFF SHIT! Don't even come lookin' for me.
                          It must be something YOU did.
