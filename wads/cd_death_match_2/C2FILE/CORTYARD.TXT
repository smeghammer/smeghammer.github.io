STORY...                   
===========================

You have just cleaned out the hellspawn in UAC's main offices and now they
send you off to clean up their branch offices. Man, when do we get a
break??

This level is actually the first of 9 new levels. Hope you like it.

The Email address is a friend's, so keep the flames to a reasonable level.

Cheers.
