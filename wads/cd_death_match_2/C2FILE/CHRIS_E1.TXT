Base                    : New levels from scratch, except E1M8,
                          for which I used id Software's "Phobos
                          Anomaly" as a base.
Editor(s) used          : DEU 5.2.1; BSP 1.0; REJECT 1.0
Thanks                  : I would like to thank everyone listed in 
                          the "Additional Credits" section.  With-
                          out their input and support, I would have
                          stopped building after E1M3.  I would also
                          like to thank PCC Jon and PC Sylva at AOL.
                          Their kindness and patience have been a
                          blessing, to say the least.  And, most
                          importantly, I'd like to thank all the 
                          members of on line services who downloaded
                          these maps individually.  I hope you'll
                          enjoy playing these as a coherent episode.
