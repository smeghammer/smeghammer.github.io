Title                   : CRUSHER.WAD   
                          The level is named after the device in the courtyard
                          Figure out how to work it.   If all else fails, read
                          the instructions. :)

Description             : This is my first level.   It is a combination of
                          all my great ideas I wanted to put into a level.
                          Since this is my first level, it has the mandatory
                          room with lots o' enemies.   There is a large maze
                          which can be solved using the "stay to the left"
                          method.   All secrets are hinted at so you won't
                          have to push every bit of wall to get 100% secrets.
                          Difficulty levels are implemented but it is easy on
                          skills 1-2 and I wouldn't recommend playing it.
                          Skill 4 is tough even for me, but it is the most 
                          fun to play.   Also, take a look at the overpass.

* Construction *

Base                    : New level from scratch
Build Time              : Too long!
Editor(s) used          : DEU 5.0, DEU 5.1, and BSP11x
Known Bugs              : Several adjacent rooms west of the starting room
                          have two sided linedefs as walls.   Because of this
                          the demons can attack through the walls.  I did this
                          before I had much experience in DEU.   I have tried
                          to fix it several times but each time DEU trashes my
                          level by mixing up all the references and texture
                          names.   If anyone can fix this, please do it and
                          mail it to me.
