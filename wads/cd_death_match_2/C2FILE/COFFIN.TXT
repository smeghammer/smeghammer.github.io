New WADs: COFFIN.WAD: Episode #2, Mission #1

Special Notes:

1. Yes, you wimps can save (F2) this.  We heroes, we true heroes, have
trained ourselves to not rely on such backless behavior.

2. Big expanse here, so she's going to run a little on the "chunky"
side, sorry!  Not much extra time lately, this was sort of spit out
quickly.  But please give 'er a go...

3. This a Death Match level.  Do not look for exits and such.

4. Level layout is simplistic on purpose.

5. We tried to incorporate a dozen or so "battle areas" within The
Coffin.  Try the Cross Teleports, use the high vantage points to your
advantage, unleash the Cross's Demons on your 'friends', and...

6. Find the secret area and you can blast your opponents yourself, or
you can unleash the furries from Hell to do the nasty work for you
(really a sense of satisfaction listening to the big bastards pummel
your former friends!).  Good for at least a dozen of your opponents
frags to find this place.

7. Please, Robert and DFG, do not tell us about texture misallignments
and bitch to us about bad downloads!  We have enough problems just living
our lives over here and do not need the extra pressures!

    ...remember guys, always kidding, please byte us back!
