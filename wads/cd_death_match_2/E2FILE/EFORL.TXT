* Misc info *

This .wad tries to combine all those elements of Deathmatching that we find 
most pleasing; for example not too powerful weapons available, lots of 
lurking-places, relatively small area, weapons available at all DM starting
positions etc. There are some monsters, but if you don't want them in your 
deathmatch, use the -nomonsters switch. There are no teleports, but so what ?
They are confusing anyway (at least to us). 
This is designed for the Deathmatch 2.0 rules, so use them.

Please let us know if you (dis)liked the level... we like getting mail!
