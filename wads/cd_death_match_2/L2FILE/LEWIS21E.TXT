Hi,

This is the E version of my canyons/outdoor wad. It is 99% complete.
On monday, I will upload the final version, IF there is a final version.
Please play this and enjoy. If you see errors or bugs in the WAD,
please email lewis@c2d2e2.wes.army.mil. I can complete it fairly easily
tho I do know the teleport sequence and I know where the stuff is.

Thanks to the creators of DEU 5.0 and BSP 1.0. I made the level with
DEU 5.0 and rebuilt the nodes with BSP 1.0. Thanks!

Lewis
