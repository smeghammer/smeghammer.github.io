                        Wendy's career was always going to be diverse. She began as a jazz musician before turning her attentions to the classical repertoire. She received a 1st class degree in classical singing from the Birmingham Conservatoire, won the Gordon Clinton Prize for English Song and was a member of 'Live Music Now' before joining international touring group 'the Swingle Singers'. 
                        During her five years with this renowned a cappella group Wendy performed with many of the worlds most famous orchestra's and opera companies, as well as recording 5 albums with them.
                        Wendy has worked extensively for classical contemporary concerts both as a soloist and ensemble singer. On many occasions, she worked very closely with the composers.
                        "...rapt, plaintive, slightly jazz-inflected and beautifully controlled, Nieper was the show stopping highlight." Birmingham Evening Post

In the UK she has performed in the Wigmore Hall, the Purcell Room, the Royal Academy of Music, the Holywell Music Room, Oxford, and the Austrian Institute, London.

                    <p>
                        Chris Britton was born in 1953 in London and received his first musical training as a Junior Exhibitioner 
                        at the Royal College of Music, studying flute and bassoon. After a period of working as an orchestral 
                        flute-player with the BBC he settled in Oxford in 1983 where he built up a substantial teaching practice 
                        both privately and in schools. In July of last year he gave up his school-teaching to focus more on his 
                        playing career. As well as recording (he is currently engaged on a CD of unaccompanied flute music by 
                        Bach), he enjoys a busy and varied playing schedule, with local professional orchestras, the guitarist 
                        Raymond Burley and the Abingdon-based Pavlova Wind Quintet. Chris has had a long association with Raymond 
                        Head dating back to the days when both were teaching at Tudor Hall School, Banbury. Chris has performed 
                        Raymond's 'Sky Dance' many times in concerts and has recorded it.

                    <p>
                        In the 60s I was quite definitely a Stockhausen groupy because I found his music exciting and 
                        new.  However, after studying composition in London I went to Dartington in Devon and began to 
                        breathe a different air. A spell teaching in Cambridgeshire and Devon and then Rome (where I was a 
                        repetiteur  for Hans Werner Henze's first cantiere in Montepulciano, Tuscany) gradually broadened 
                        my outlook. Life took over and I found myself feeling disillusioned by the cold and inhibiting world 
                        of the then contemporary music. It was at this moment that I was drawn into a different world; the 
                        world of Indian influences on the arts in western culture that was to result in two books and much 
                        lecturing in various countries, broadcasting, and championing the work of Gustav Holst. Eventually 
                        this returned me to the creative and communicative world of music; conducting, composing and teaching 
                        voice and piano in Chipping Norton. Today contemporary music is inclusive, without boundaries or a 
                        defined style - the possibilities seem endless.

                    <p>
                        Clement Jewitt uncovered the composing muse within himself after a life review following 
                        simultaneous crises in his personal and professional lives in his forties. He formerly 
                        designed computer information systems, but always had some connection with music making. 
                        He regards music as essentially an act of friendship. In the last decade he has been 
                        practising as an improvisationist, and leads group improvisation workshops.
                        Clement has a strong interest in how sound and music is received by body, mind and spirit, 
                        which has lead to investigations in acoustics, physiology and transpersonal psychology.  
                        He was recently awarded a PhD from Birmingham Conservatoire, writing the extended song 
                        cycle 'The Night Sea' as part of the study of the application of a post-Jungian model of 
                        the psyche to creative endeavour.  Excerpts from 'The Night Sea' are included in the 
                        programme of the concerts.
