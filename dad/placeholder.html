        Eidos Inventions (www.eidos-inventions.co.uk)</h1>
        <p>Coming soon...</p>
        <p>This website will eventually display information on all my creative work: fuller information on the music; together with artworks, 
        photographs, and writings.</p>
        <p>Full texts of writings, mainly reflecting my professional lives, will be uploaded except where the text is not available through 
        loss or other reasons, or is too technical to be of any interest except to a highly specialised readership (who will have seen 
        them elsewhere anyway).</p>
        <p>Artworks are mainly from the 1950s and 60s, predominantly but not exclusively of the built environment.
        Photographs are a minor collection of more or less randomly chosen subjects.</p>
